Games against game engines</h1>

<hr>

<p><strong>Drago</strong> can be interfaced with the game engines
implementing the Go Text Protocol (GTP) version 2, GNU Go for
instance. The Play mode proposes several options and remembers
the result and handicap of the last game to set the handicap for
a new game.</p>

<h2><a name="DefinitionAndParameters">Definition and settings of

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The definition and the settings of the game engines is done in
the <a href="Options.htm#GameEngine">Game engines tab</a> of
option window.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Lancement">Starting a new game</a></h2>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<p>A new game is started with the <em>Play/New</em> menu or with
the <img src="YingYang.gif" align="absmiddle" width="23"
height="21"> button. A dialog appears, allowing you to select:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the game engine and possibly its level,</li>
    <li>the initial position and the color played by the game
        engine,</li>
    <li>the board size, handicap and komi.,</li>
    <li>the time settings,</li>
    <li>the rules used for scoring.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Selection of game engine and level</h3>

<p><img src="Engine-Select.gif" width="256" height="132"></p>

<p>The game engine may be chosen in the list of engine games
defined and installed by user. If the list is empty, a message is
displayed proposing to the user to open the game engine tab in
option window.</p>

<p>The level can be selected from 1 to 10. This parameter may be
set only for Gnu Go.</p>

<p><img src="Engine-Level.gif" width="260" height="86"></p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Starting position and color selection</h3>

<p><img src="Engine-Position.gif" width="259" height="145"></p>

<p>The starting position can be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a new game. In this case it is possible to select the
        color played by the game engine, the board size, the
        handicap and the komi.</li>
    <li>the current position. In this case it is only possible to
        select the color played by the game engine.</li>
    <li>a new game in auto handicap mode. In this case you can
        only select the board size. All other parameters (color,
        handicap and komi) are set by the interface according to
        the result of the last game, to minimize the difference
        of strength between the user and the engine. In this
        mode, the komi is always 0.5 for handicap games and 5.5
        when there is no handicap.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Board size, handicap and komi selection</h3>

<p><img src="Engine-Param.gif" width="257" height="94"></p>

<p>The possibility to configure theses values depends on the
initial position mode. When the selection is possible:</p>

<p>- The size can be configured between 5 and 19.</p>

<p>- The values 0, 0.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 or 8 are proposed for the
komi, although any other value can be entered. For handicap
games, the komi is given by the <a href="#Score">scoring mode</a>.</p>

<p>- The handicap can be selected between 0 and 9 with the
following limitations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>there is no handicap for board sizes smaller than 7,</li>
    <li>maximum handicap is 4 for board size 7 and all even board
        sizes,</li>
    <li>maximum handicap is 9 for all other cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>- The placement of the handicap stones is free when the
related box is checked. When the user has to set the handicap
stones, a dialog is opened showing the remaining stones to set:</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Selection of time limits</h3>

<p><img src="Engine-Timing.gif" width="238" height="252"></p>

<p>Several time limit modes are available (depending on the game
engine):</p>

<ul>
    <li>no time limits,</li>
    <li>given time for full game,</li>
    <li>given time for each move,</li>
    <li>Canadian byo-yomi: an initial time without move
        limitation, followed by an unlimited number of time
        periods with limited move number.</li>
</ul>

<p>The additional check box enables to apply the time limits only
to the engine and let the user play without any limitation.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3><a name="Scoring selection">Scoring selection</a></h3>

<p><img src="Engine-Score.gif" width="244" height="96"></p>

<p>Two scoring modes are available depending on the game engine:</p>

<ul>
    <li>territory counting (used in Japanese rules). Free
        territory intersections plus prisoners are counted.</li>
    <li>area counting (used in Chinese rules). Free territory
        intersections plus living stones are counted. A N stone
        handicap is taken into account by giving a N+0.5 komi to
        White.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>More options relative to undo, starting tab and saving after a
game are available in <a
href="AdvancedOptions.htm#GamesAgainstEngines">advanced settings</a>.</p>

<h3>Available commands</h3>

<p>While a game is being played, the following commands are
available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>play a move, then the game engine plays the next move</li>
    <li>go backward one move</li>
    <li>go backward to the start of the game</li>
    <li>go forward one move</li>
    <li>return to the last move played</li>
    <li>play a pass move, with the <em>Play/Pass</em> menu</li>
    <li>resign, with the <em>Play/Resign</em> menu</li>
    <li>undo the last move if undo is enabled</li>
</ul>

<p>During a game, as well as during other modes, some <a
href="#Analysis functions">game analysis commands</a> are
available if the game engine set for these functions makes them
available.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Resignation</h3>

<p><strong>Drago</strong> handles resignation from the player as
well as from the game engine, especially from GNU Go which can
resign on 19x19 games since version 3.6.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3><a name="Score">Score</a></h3>

<p>The game is ended with two consecutive pass moves. When the
game is finished, <strong>Drago</strong> displays detailed
results at the right of the main window:</p>

<p><img src="Result.gif" width="177" height="194"></p>

<p><strong>Drago</strong> uses Japanese counting (territory +
prisoners) or Chinese counting (territory + stones). The <a
href="#Scoring selection">selection of the scoring mode</a>
depends on the engine and is done when starting the game. </p>

<p>For games without handicap, the komi can be set freely before
starting the game. For no komi games (&quot;one stone
handicap&quot;), the komi is always set as 0.5. For handicap
games (H &gt; 1), the komi is set as follow:</p>

<ul>
    <li>with Japanese counting, the komi is 0.5 whatever the
        handicap,</li>
    <li>with Chinese counting, the komi is H+0.5 if handicap is H
        stones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there is no way to dispute the score if there is a
problem with the result.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Analysis functions">Analysis functions</a></h2>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<p>During a game, as well as during other modes, some game
analysis commands are available if the game engine set for these
functions makes them available. These commands enable to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>ask for a score estimate, displayed in the status bar,
        with the <em>Play/Score</em> menu,</li>
    <li>ask for a suggestion for the next move, displayed in the
        status bar and on the board, with the <em>Play/Suggest</em>
        menu,</li>
    <li>show influence regions on board, with the <em>Play/Show
        influence regions</em> menu,</li>
    <li>show group status, with the <em>Play/Group status</em>
        menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>These functions are currently available only for Gnu Go,</li>
    <li>The relevance of the results given by these commands are
        of course related to the rank of the engine game.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>Some commands are available only if the engine game supports
them. If this is not the case, the associated options are greyed.</p>
