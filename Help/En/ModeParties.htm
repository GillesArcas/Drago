<h2><a name="Lancement">Starting a game session</a></h2>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<p>A game session is started with the <em>Replay/Replay session</em>
menu. The options of the session are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the selection mode of the game to be replayed,</li>
    <li>the color to be played,</li>
    <li>the number of moves to replay,</li>
    <li>the number of attempts per move.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Game selection</h3>

<p><b><img src="Replay-Select.gif" width="346" height="54"></b></p>

<p>The selection of the game to be replayed can be done as
follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Loaded game</em>: the current game is replayed.</li>
    <li><em>Sequential</em>: the game following the last game
        played in this mode is replayed.</li>
    <li><em>Random</em>: a game randomly selected from the
        current file is replayed.</li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Color selection</h3>

<p><b><img src="Replay-Color.gif" width="349" height="57"></b></p>

<p>A game can be replayed with the user playing with Black, White
or both colors.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Number of moves to replay</h3>

<p><img src="Replay-Number.gif" width="341" height="114"></p>

<p>A game can be fully replayed, limited to its beginning by
choosing the <em>Fuseki</em> mode or started from the current
position of the current game. In fuseki mode, an input box
enables to select the number of moves to replay.</p>

<p>It is possible to start from the current position only when
the current game is selected.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Selection of the number of attempts per move</h3>

<p><img src="Replay-Attempts.gif" width="347" height="55"></p>

<p>It is possible to have only one attempt per move. In that
case, the correct move is played as soon as the user has played
an incorrect move. It is also possible to have an unlimited
number of attempts. In that case, a hint is displayed to inform
about the distance to the correct move.</p>

<h3>Available commands</h3>

<p>While replaying a game, the following commands are available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>play a move: if it is correct, <strong>Drago</strong>
        answers with the next move (if the user is not playing
        both colors). If the move is wrong, it is surrounded
        briefly in red, then removed. If only one attempt has
        been select, the correct move is played and surrounded in
        green.</li>
    <li>go backward one move, </li>
    <li>go to the beginning of the game, </li>
    <li>go forward one move without going beyond the last
        replayed move,</li>
    <li>go to the last replayed move. </li>
</ul>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Distance to the correct move</h3>

<p><img src="Replay-Hint.gif" width="200" height="40"></p>

<p>If an unlimited number of attempts has been selected, a hint
is displayed to inform about the distance to the correct move. If
the correct move cannot be found, it is possible to go forward by
using the next move command.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Scores</h3>

<p>When the game is over, <strong>Drago</strong> displays the
score for the replayed game. The score is the number of correctly
replayed moves expressed as a percentage of the number of moves
in the game.</p>

<p><img src="Replay-Result.gif" width="199" height="37"></p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<p>The best scores reached for a game are stored and can be
displayed with the <em>Replay/Index</em> command. This index
stores for each game: the number of times the game has been
replayed, the best scores for the three possible selections of
color (Black, White or both) and for the full game or fuseki
modes.</p>
