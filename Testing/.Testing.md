# Testing

The testing feature concerns only editing and exporting. The user interface can not be tested this way.

Tests are specified with a batch-like syntax. This syntax offers a limited set of instructions and settings parameters. The instructions are matched into internal procedures mainly dedicated to testing.

Tests are stored in Drago/Testing folder. Each test is stored with a batch file (Drago batch file for testing) and a text file giving a reference result.

A INI file stores the list of tests. The sections of this files are displayed as caption in the testing window.

The testing window is displayed when:

- keying ctrl+shift+DBG, which open a Debug menu in Drago interface,
- choosing "Tests divers".

Note that the Debug menu is available when starting Drago from the IDE. When the window is opened, it is possible to select the tests to carry on, to make a new reference or to carry on tests and compare the results with the references.

_Limitations_

When generating figures, the reference text files store only CRC32 values. In case of differences, it is not possible to go back to the figures for comparison. It would be better to encode the figures into something like code64 but this will increase furthermore the reference text files.
