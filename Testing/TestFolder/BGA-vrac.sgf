;W[hp]C[W 10 seems to be the wrong direction.  When black plays DIAMOND white 
TRIANGLE is put in an uncomfortable position.  Meanwhile, the white stones in 
the lower side were already strong, and didn't really need the reinforcement.

Instead, white 10 at DIAMOND seems natural.

it was, the h
ane of black 19 \(TRIANGLE\) seems to help white and weaken black on the 
outside.  Meanwhile, the territorial gain of having the black stones up on 
the fourth line instead of one at d13 is negligable. ]
;B[fj];W[fi]
;B[hi]C[This hane \(B 25\) creates a cutt
ing point in black's \(already somewhat thin\) shape and doesn't put any 
particular pressure on white, since W has plenty of liberties.  Just jumping 
to TRIANGLE would be better.

Black should note that pressing as hard as possible directly against the 
oponent's stones isn't necessarily the strongest way to attack.]M[ij]

black has to go back to reinforce his other group, he loses his central 
cutting stones, which is of course a disaster.  The game now looks clearly 
good for white.]

foolhardy.

Perhaps black should just play around TRIANGLE to try to keep some 
territorial balance.  Or just reinforce his center and lower right groups

center dies like this, the game is really over.  It seems to me that white 
should capture with TRIANGLE instead of taking the three stones with "a", but 
it hardly matters at this poi

After this there were still some strange moves by both sides, but at any 
rate, white should win easily.

;W[qj]C[reid:  I think w would be better of continueing out into the center with o10 or n10.  In this game, center power will be very significant since it will affect all four of the side moyos.  r10 looks big, and it looks like w can continue by attacking the corner, but b has sente to take r12, and w has no base.]

;B[eh]C[reid: e12 looks too small.  Looking at the black formation, e12 wants to be at least to f12.  But the real key for b here is that white has lots of weaknesses around l12, l14, and f15.  Because of these weaknesses, b can be a lot more daring than e12.]
;W[ll]C[reid: a nice move! helps fix up white's weaknesses while building the bottom moyo a little.  May even have some effect on the lower right corner aji.]
;B[fm]C[reid: black's shape with f17, d8, c11, and e12 looks very awkward.  b could be much more positive here, since his formations are already pretty thick.  perhaps b g5, l10, or something around  j14 would be better.  And fixing the corner aji with o4 is pretty huge, too.]

;B[pd];W[dd]
;L[qp][oq]C[MG:  Notice the orientation of Black's komoku and his hoshi stones.  His hoshi exerts influence along the top and right, his komoku only along the right side.  This combination is about as good as it gets.


Consider playing the komoku at 'a' instead of Q3:  now its direction of play is along the bottom, and the stones don't reinforce each other as they did before.


Still, on rare occasions, you see a professional play at 'a' instead of Q3, but he always follows up at 'b'.  Note that the primary direction of play from an a-b shimari is along the right side, and the Black stones again reinforce each other \(same idea, different implementation\).

 ThomasJ 2k : I am.]B[pq]
;C[MG:  A rather common parallel fuseki, which has a section in Rin's _Basic Fuseki Dictionary_ \(Japanese\).

 ThomasJ 2k : At least I think, I am :-\)]W[dp]
;L[po][pk][qk][dn][jp]C[MG:  Black missed the direction of play, which is on the right side.  In any case, making a

shimari is almost always larger than playing a kakari against a hoshi.  \(Note:  A shimari and
a kakari against a _komoku_ are often equivalent.\)


The book move is a shimari at 'a', although I might be tempted to play at 'b' or 'c' \(Chinese
openings\).


Still, F3 doesn't lose much.  If White is reasonable and responds with 'd', Black could build
the Mt-Fuji shape with 'e' \(one of my favorite positions\).


BTW, if one of the White stones had been played on komoku, playing a high kakari against it
would also be an option for Black.


ThomasJ:   The last move was actually used by Franz-Joseph Dickhut, german 6 dan,

in a tournament game against another high-dan player \(I don't quite remember whom\).

He quoted, that it had been used several times before, and actually made a long

and retailed description of this opening in the "Deutsche Go Zeitung", last issue.

There he furthermore made a reference to a game between two 7-dan professionals

from Korea, who had used this opening, and both players felt it as a normal opening

for both parts. Therefore I wanted to use it myself, to see, what would happen.]B[fq]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np]
;C[MG:  White's played an aggressive, but popular, variation.  Playing 'a' instead of M4 would have been quite good for White \(White follows the usual joseki then invades at 'b'\).]L[pl][qc]W[lp]
;B[no];W[pm]
;C[MG:  The joseki has Black drawing back to 'a' instead.  I see two reasons:


\(1\)  The ikken tobi here is equivalent to crawling twice, since 'b' is sente for White.  If Black had played 'a' instead, he would have been able to hane if White had pushed at 'b'.

\(2\)  The ikken tobi has the weakness at 'c', which sets up a peep at 'd'.]L[ql][pl][qi][rl]B[qk]
;W[nn]
;C[MG:  Black usually plays at 'a'; the move Black chose allows White to wedge in at 'b' -- if Black loses a liberty, he could be in trouble.]L[mn][mo]B[lo]
;W[jp];B[mn]
;C[MG:  This would be better shape at 'a', and it is aji keshi \('b' will be much less effective if Black answers at 'c' -- i.e., this is also aji keshi\).]L[nm][qi][ql]W[pl]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[oj];B[pi];W[jn]
;L[dr][cq][dq][gn]C[MG:  Black should do something here, but this move is a bit weak.  Alternatives: 'a' though
'd'.  \(Certainly you should slide first to 'a' if you intend to play J3.\)


ThomasJ: I was a bit too fast playing around here. I am aware, that my last move was very bad \(an unforced under-shoulder-move cannot be good. I made it to deprive white of his base and make a base for myself here, but still this move is bad.


MG:  The idea of giving your stones a base while depriving the enemy of his can't be faulted, but White's group is light and on the fourth and sixth lines, so White need not worry much about his stones right now.


ThomasJ:  From the mentioned alternatives to this move I would now rather play d, since this gives no connection possibilities to the white center group and gives the black group an escape route to the center.


MG:  The ogeima jump is really handy sometimes but, because of its loose connection to the other stones, you have to be ready to sacrifice something.  I've seen many players in similar situations try to maintain a connectivity that isn't there and end up losing big instead of giving up a stone or two.


ThomasJ:  Apart from that, the white corner may easily come under attack and may be surrounded if not answered or answered incorrectly.


MG:  Here's where studying a book on corner positions can show some profit \(I have some, but in Japanese 8-\).]B[iq]
;W[jq]
;C[MG:  Even now, a slide would be good.  White answered, making J3 kikashi, so Black can turn elsewhere.  This is a two- or three-point move in a life-and-death situation.]B[ip]
;C[MG:  I'd play 'a' or 'b' instead \(these are _huge_\), but this may be playable if White can make use of his thickness and keep Black in \(if there were a White stone at 'c' I might play it myself\).]L[eq][er]W[io]
;C[MG:  Slide now?]B[ho]
;W[hn];B[go];W[mm]
;C[MG:  'a' is bigger and the focus of life and death for these two groups \(though neither will die in normal play\).


Just play 'b' if you must play here, threatening a double atari.  The original atari is also aji keshi \(if White extends in answer to 'b', then 'c' is worth a point in the endgame\).]L[rq][lm][op]B[nm]
;W[on];B[lm];W[ml]
;C[MG:  Better to save this as a ko threat.  It's only worth a couple of points if White grabs it.  Of course, if you're about to launch a strong attack on the White group, this is the place to start. . . .]B[ko]
;W[jo]
;L[fc][dn][dr][gn]C[MG:  This is kikashi, but not useful right now.  White's two groups are already separated and Black is strong.  There are still _big_ points left on the board: 'a' to 'd', for example.]B[ll]
;W[mk];B[lk]
;C[MG:  White should have extended.  This gives Black a hane for free.]W[nd]
;B[mj];W[nl]
;C[MG:  Fine.  No need to get fancy.]B[pf]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[kc]
;C[MG:  This is just about the only interesting point on the board, especially since White seems to be working on a moyo.]B[cf]
;W[di]
;L[cc]C[MG:  This is quite OK, but with White's kind-of-weak stones at the bottom, you could probably invade at 'a' and reduce considerably any moyo White may get.  Just a thought.]B[ef]
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bi];W[gf];B[cn];W[dn];B[co];W[cp]
;L[do][eo][ep]C[MG:  White should have connected, perhaps.  As Black, I'd push through and cut \('a' - 'c'\).


Black's slide would have been ideal much earlier, when he only had the small group to worry about, but now it's rather bad:  If White connects, C5C6 are going to come under a strong attack.  Since White is close to safe. . . .]B[dr]
;W[do];B[cm]
;C[MG:  White's kikashi misses the focus of the game.  Consider a White probe at 'a'.  If Black at 'b', then White 'd'; or if Black 'c', the sequence White 'e', 'f', and 'b'.]L[ci][bh][bj][ck][dg][df]W[oi]
;B[ph];W[gn]
;C[MG:  The hane may be an overplay, since White has forcing moves like 'a', and Black is left with a weak shape \(imagine the variations involving 'b' and 'c'\).


I'd just extend at 'b' then play something like 'd' to protect the weak group on the left.]L[dm][fo][ir][ci]B[fn]
;W[fm];B[em]
;W[fo]L[dm]C[MG:  White does aji keshi: he should have just pushed through at 'a'.]
;B[en]
;W[fp]C[MG:  This exploits Black's shape problem here.]
;B[gq];W[dm];B[el];W[gp]
;B[hp]L[ir]C[MG:  The connection is bad on principle.  Just dropping down to 'a' is enough to settle the Black group.


The two stones aren't important right now; White has sente, so life isn't a problem for him at the moment \(though he has to read carefully to make sure he doesn't lose sente\).]
;W[ir];B[hq]
;W[cr]L[hr]C[MG:  White 'a' would have killed some stones, I think.]
;B[eo]C[MG:  It's kikshi, but the only thing this move does is reduce Black's liberties by one.  His five stones are going to be a real burden to him.]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[cq];B[hr]
;W[dl]L[jr]C[MG:  Connecting at 'a' gives White a chance to capture.]

;W[bm]L[al][am]C[MG:  Because Black can force with 'a' and 'b', this capture's not worth much more than eight points in gote \(about the same as a monkey jump\).  It only looks big.]

MG:  But connecting would have killed you:  Black at 'a', White 'b', then G2, 'c', 'd', and
'e'.


ThomasJ: My original comment was rather pointed on the ko, not on connecting. This ko would have been rather big, so maybe I should have played it instead.


MG:  Actually, winning the ko would not be so large \(and would cost you the group if you lost, which is why I didn't even consider it\).


If you win the ko, you have about 13 or 14 points \(mostly in the lower right, by killing the aji of White 'f'\); if you play at G2 then 'd', you have 3 or 4.  This is a difference of about ten points, but it's taken you two moves to gain them .  The threats around 'g' are worth more, so I don't know if you could be sure of winning the ko \(especially if you consider the huge loss if the lower left Black group dies \[>35 points\]\).


I see Black risking at least one large group to fight a ko worth 5 points a move.  I might play this way if Black had many more ko threats than White and the game were close. . . .]B[gr]L[ir][gs][cs][hs][es][nr][kj]

April 29 1994

Black wins by resignation.

Commentary by TS and Max Golem 3d*

----------

 copernics 6k*: h2 ? or not ?
 sand 4k*: 2]
;W[ce];B[pp];W[cn]
;B[jp]L[fp][pj]C[TS: Simply playing 'a' seems better; this leaves White the next move.


MG:  Playing the bottom hoshi is actually quite common \(and if Black has played near 'b' it is ideal\).  Of course, Black has to know how to deal with the various double kakaris that may follow when playing this way.]
;C[MG:  An interesting move \(Takemiya has played it from time to time as a part of his "cosmic" fuseki\), but it has the drawback of forcing Black toward his K4 stone with 'a' \(which is something Black wants to do anyway\).  Still, if White is expert in playing a moyo game, this is probably playable.]W[en]L[fp]
;B[fp]
;W[md]C[MG:  Nice.  Consistent with White's moyo strategy.]
;L[ed][ee]B[dc]C[TS: This is what I hoped for.


MG:  Black has to play at 'a' or 'b' to limit White's moyo.  D17 is playing right into his hands.]
;L[fc][fd][gc]C[MG:  The keima kake is perfect here:  pressing down on d17 with sente should be automatic with the thickness White has on the left side. Even without such thickness, White should look at the pressing move first when considering alternatives \('a', 'b', 'c', etc.\). Another advantage of the kake is that it's pretty much impossible for Black to tenuki.]W[ed]
;L[ee][de]C[MG: A _bad_ move.  This sort of push is playable only when cutting immediately after at 'a' is useful \(which it rarely is\).  The push is also aji keshi:  Black may later want to jump through at 'b' to cut on the other side.]B[dd]
;W[de]
;L[ee]B[ec]M[dd]C[TS: This contradicts the marked stone, whose purpose is to cut at 'a'. If Black doesn't want to cut, better to omit the marked stone and simply play e17.]
;W[fd]
;B[fc]C[TS: Now the drawback of the marked stone is obvious; Black would like to jump to 'a', but he has a shortage of liberties.]M[dd]L[gc]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic]
;W[ej]L[dj][gn][hp][cj]C[MG:  This looks like trying to do two things at once but not accomplishing either well.  I'd play 'a' to solidify the moyo or 'b' \(the better choice as it also threatens 'c'\) to expand the moyo.


White can always cap with the marked stone if Black invades at 'd'.  Still, it's hard to know what the best move is here.]M[ej]
;B[bo]
;L[qf][gn][qn][nq]C[MG:  White's move is rather too territory oriented.  White is staking the whole game on being able to make big points in the center.

Any of choices 'a' through 'd' instead would be more interesting.]W[bn]
;B[gn]
;L[gm][hj]C[MG:  I'm not sure that White should answer in this area with so many interesting kakaris to play elsewhere.  A better local defense might be 'a' or 'b'.]W[gl]
;B[fm]
;C[MG:  'a' instead of F8 might work out better.]L[el]W[fl]
;B[dm];W[em];B[dn];W[dl];B[cm];W[do];B[co];W[eo];B[cl];W[ep]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[ck]
;C[MG:  Black missed White 'a', Black 'b', then 'c', connect and 'd'. If White saves his stones, then the Black corner develops aji at 'e'.]L[bl][el][bm][dj][bq]B[dk]
;C[MG:  Too bad!  'a' would probably have won the game for White.

TS: <slap!> What a moron!]L[bl]W[el]
;B[bk];W[cj];B[bl]
;W[nq]L[qn][mp][hr][mo][nq]M[fp][jp][fm][gn]C[TS: This looks overplayish.. I was afraid that 'a' is too slow, and that by sketching out a moyo by itself would enable Black to win on territory alone. I therefore reasoned I should try to engineer \(fake? :-\) an attack against the marked stones and attempt to stake out the moyo by attacking. 


MG:  Invading so deeply between two strong enemy positions is probably just looking for trouble.  My guess is that breaking up a potential Black moyo by playing 'a' would be enough.  White's likely to get something on the right side when all's said and done, and the 3-3 invasion and slide to 'c' are miai so Black won't get as many points here as it looks.


To invade the lower side, even 'b' is probably too low -- maybe 'd' would be a good place to start.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[lp]
;C[MG:  Black's not going to get many points on the lower side and his group is pretty safe, so F3 is not useful, in fact it weakens his left corner.  \('a' is a popular point to begin the attack on this White shape.\)]L[kq]B[fq]
;W[er];B[jn]
;C[MG:  This makes one of the standard shapes, but I'd play 'a' first to see what Black does.  \(If Black moves in such a way as to give the white group easy life whenever he wants it, then play 'b' instead of the marked stone -- this makes 'c' --> 'f' and 'd' --> 'e' miai, and leaves open the possibility of 3-3 invasions on the right side.\)]L[jq][qi][qk][qg][ql][qf]W[mm]M[mm]
;L[jl][id][om][qi][pf]B[bj]C[TS: this seems a bit small for this stage, although I don't know exactly what Black _should_ do.


MG:  Agreed.  It's only points, no real threat on anything.  And gote!  You want to make threats that take points.  Almost any big-looking move would be preferable for Black \(consider 'a' to 'e'\).]
;L[jk][mk][om][km]AW[jl]C[MG:  A great move!  Maybe not the exact correct point, but the right idea.  Maybe 'a' instead, and if Black plays against the lower-right group White can dodge with 'b', 'c', or 'd'.]
;B[ln]
;C[MG:  I'd rather not peep and weaken the White wall in the center, which already has bad aji.  \(The peep probably kills White's chances with the 'b' aji.\)  Does 'a' work?]L[mn][jq]W[ko]

;C[MG:  If the White moyo were closed at the left, this would be a perfect move.  It's hard to find the best move here, but saving the two stones should be considered \('a' goes a long way in closing the center, and the large group gets a certain eye \[the eye alone isn't enough to justify taking gote, though\]\).

Note that, if Black forces 'b' --> 'c', White gets a couple of liberties in the corner in sente with the placement of 'd', which will come in handy in the semeai.\)

As for style, W was willing to sacrifice stones when needed.  This was

giving up the two stones around J12 led to some connectivity problems.  B 
missed some chances to sacrifice stones.


B was generally better at keeping sente.  He pretty much kept it from white's

 kyu players who were also observing the game.

Mi3ke:  You (jloup) have a couple of very important principles to work on.  
Knowing when to play on the second line and understanding how the stones 
"walk".  I have given you a couple of demonstrations and some reading 
suggestions at the very end of the g

;W[qo]WL[1715.0]C[Mi3ke: White's decision to invade right away is suspect.

Better is to take the open top side either with a move around k16 or an 
approach at o17 or o16.

The standard way to tackle the 3-4 stone in the chinese formation is with a 
light reducing move at p5 to which black responds with a knights move in 
either direction.

Chinese and san-ren-sei are alike in that the timing of invasions against 
them is critical.  Invade too late and the moyo will be too big, invade too 
early and your fate may be even worse, with weak groups running all over the 
board and your stones never 

able to recover.]
;B[qp]BL[1730.0]
(
;W[ql]WL[1706.0]C[Mi3ke: r8 is a bad move.
White's basic idea is ok... "ignore the first stone and try to make a light 
base."  

but....

the problem is that r8 is begging black to play the very move he would *love* 
to play but might seem slow normally at r9.  See the shape of black's two 
stones.  fall in love with it.  They have 5 liberties to white's 3 and face 
outward.  It is called the 

iron pillar and is considered excellent as long as it is near a weak white 
position.  (In a vacuum it is a little slow).

White should instead do the obvious and play q5 -- or attach at r9 
immediately.

(
;B[oo]BL[1604.0]C[Mi3ke: s4 does more to threaten 
white's eyeshape than p5, and is quite big territorially.  There is only so 
much development you can get out of k4, and this area is likely to turn into 
territory as white runs, anyway, so it isn't impera
tive to cut
 white off like this.

The optimal development of the chinese opening is for black to build 
territory on the bottom and thickness on the upper right when white invades.

The key to s4 is eyespace.  go back and look at the variations.  This a 
really important.  Second line moves are not slow when they are critical to 
the eyespace of two groups.  This is the kind of move that should *jump* out 
at you when you are attacking 

a weak group like this.]
;W[pl]WL[1646.0]
;B[qi]BL[1322.0]C[jl: B r11 is awful, 
should have been at p9. I has also considered B r10 but didn't like it.

Mi3ke:  Well you were correct not to like r10 :-O...  r11 is much better than 
that.

But p9 is superior.  remember as long as the r9 stones have 4 liberties or 
more and the ladder is good, the clamp at s11 won't work.  And even if it 
did, the difference of the hane in this situation is hard to overstate.  Read 
the section about the strugg
le to get ahead in Kageyama's "Lessons in the fundamentals of Go" and you may 
be enlightened.]

 evan 7k*: b has good thickness in upper right
 evan 7k*: m17 takes advantage of that

Mi3ke:  I disagree with evan here.  a more standard jump and settle would be 
fairly effective.  go back to see...

the key is that black's corner is still open.  white can invade in sente.  
better to make white play around n17/o17 and let black defend the corner in 
sente. like in the jump variation.

]
(
;W[hc]WL[1472.0]C[ evan 7k*: i dont like h17. w should jump out instead too 
narrow to make a base on the side. by jumping out w could do several things: 
set up to reduce b on right, attack the w stone on left, and do all this 
while running to safety.
although, h17 is a severe attack on f17

Mi3ke: H17 isn't severe at all.  White has taken two stones to do what he 
only needed one for.  If this is his idea why didn't he make the one space 
pincer to start with?

Black could just dive to safety at c17 and be happy that white has wasted a 
stone.  think tewari... and follow the variation.

Never make two pincers against the same stone from the same direction.

In fact, the jump that jloup played is *even* stronger.  Now white has two 
stones to take care of instead of one.]

;B[fe]BL[801.0]C[ evan 7k*: w says 
that r17 is huge for him now. agree with him
]
;W[df]WL[1439.0]C[ evan 7k*: but look how now w stones on top are under 
attack. f15 is good
]
(
;B[hd]BL[667.0]C[jl: I think that B h16 was bad. I also considered B r17 
and B c17. Both would let W control the game by attacking F17. So what should 
B have done here?

Mi3ke: if you jump to f15 you are saying that you mean to attack white.  
There is a proverb which says "Do not touch what you are trying to attack."  
It applies here in spades.

Black should have played d18, wc17, bg18 and let white stew over the 
response.  A likely one would be the attachment at m16 which serves to defend 
black's corner and turn m17 into a good move.  Actually h17 is what made m17 
a good move.  white has essenti

ally pincered himself!

If you don't understand the proverb about not touching what you are 
attacking, a good thing to hear is Bruce Wilcox's instant go lecture on 
contact fights.

In general contact fights tend to strengthen stones approx. equally.  But 
when you are strong you prefer to press the advantage!  Make contact where 
you are weak, play thickly and at a small distance where you are strong.

go back to see the sequence.

;W[id]WL[1432.0]
;B[he]BL[665.0]C[ evan 7k*: b now has good, thick shape, but 
also at the expense of giving w better shape too

Mi3ke: White's shape is much better than black's...  and it should be worse.  
consider the white play at e17]
(
;W[ie]WL[1405.0]C[ evan 7k*: b must h14. too 
big to allow w to hane at the head of two stones

Mi3ke:  evan is correct. I would even hane at j14.  later black will have 
this same opportunity but need to play f13 first.  Here white is still weak, 
and black can get away with doing it right off.]
(
;B[le]BL[589.0]C[jl: B m15 
left the corner open at r17, but B r17 again seemed too passive.

Mi3ke:  r17 *was* too passive.  The key with playing the star point is 
playing in such a way that leaving the corner open is good.  You must defend 
it obliquely.  the worst possible play is to  build two walls facing the star 
point that are only a few poi

nts away.  

You can only block in one direction, so don't play lots of stones on both 
sides until the corner is secure.  One extension is ok, but a jump like m15 
practically begs white to take the corner.  As soon as he does, either m15 or 
the thickness on the right 

are going to look stupid and overconcentrated.

Evan is correct however.  The hane is critical.

You should have played h14 or j14 as my variation shows.]

]
(
;B[rc]BL[285.0]C[ evan 7k*: in general, when your opponent has two 
extensions from a star point, then it is time to invade at the 3-3

jl: W keeps sente with the normal joseki at B 17 so I played s17 with the 
intent of letting w live on top but in gote. I needed sente to continue the 
attack on the k17 group. Unfortunately, the sequence starting with S17 ended 
up in gote for B, with disas

trous consequences.


Mi3ke:  You can get sente with p17 too...  The key is not sente/gote but the 
direction.  the big fight is over in the middle of the top where there are 
two weak groups.  By invading black's stronghold, white has given *you* the 
chance to dictate the direc
tion. Use it to get *your* stones in the important area instead of pushing 
his over there.]

;B[od]BL[277.0]C[jl: B o15 might have been better than p16

Mi3ke:  SOOHADOTO...

Evan had it right.  p17 is more important than s17.  If white gets too far 
over on the top he can use it to help his j16 group which is still attackable.
]
;W[nd]WL[1320.0]C[ evan 7k*: t18 is important

Mi3ke:  ooh. white mistake.  o17 is good enough.  you can win the game at a 
stroke, if you play carefully.]
;B[nc]BL[220.0]C[jl: I had read that B o17 
could capture the corner. But in retrospect, B n16, n17 or n18 might have 
been better to keep sente and c
ontinue the attack against k17.

Mi3ke:  you were right here. o16 is an overplay and this is how you punish 
it.  the corner is big enough to be worth gote if you do it right.]
;W[mc]WL[1299.0]
;B[nb]BL[216.0]C[ evan 7k*: w o16 stone is doomed. b can either n16 
cut, or n18 connect under

;W[md]WL[1251.0]C[ evan 7k*: there fore: w corner is in danger! b now must 
n18. fight in corner is urgent! life and death of group is at stake
]
;B[mb]BL[136.0]
;W[ld]WL[1247.0]C[ evan 7k*: yes. interesting. what does b do 
now? it is a race to kill the corner


Mi3ke: How about squeezing with l16!!!  Black makes a beautiful wall , gives 
white bad shape and *still* kills the corner.  and it's a forced walk.  
white's other choices are far worse.]
(
;B[kc]BL[65.0]
;W[kd]WL[1244.0]C[ evan 
7k*: k18. think b can now kill the w conrner. he is getting extra liberties 
at least if not making living shape. kill the corner as follows: t18 or r19.]
;B[pb]BL[1163.0]C[ evan 7k*: q18 is good. w cannot p18 or b r18
. w is just dead now in corner

jl: B p18 would be better than q18 since it would save the L17 stones (q18 
allows a W cut at M18 as the game showed). B has killed the W invasion, but 
in gote unfortunately, so W can now strongly attack the F17 group.

Mi3ke:  another thing to look at is how that m15 stone looks...  The key 
reason this is bad is not the gote as much as how much white is strengthened. 
 He has many liberties and is out in the open.  that is what weakens black's 
stones more than anything. 

 In the squeeze variation white's group is weaker and the black thickness is 
closer to the h15 stones, making the fight there much easier to handle.]
;W[db]WL[1173.0]C[ evan 7k*: i like the hane at h14 for w. d18 is also good, 
it attacks the f17 group. h3 
is also a big pt for w.

jl: I think that W is leading now because the f17 group will be a burden for 
B for the rest of the game.]
;B[gc]BL[995.0]
;W[hb]WL[1146.0]C[evan 7k*: i 
would say c3 is premature now, but not premature for b if w h3. then the 
double extension, invade rules a
pply. w is not attacking b group at top. but he should not expect to kill it, 
just attack it, harass it and build thickness for hi
mself, or territory on the left side while attacking

jl: evan is correct; I had also predicted the same sad outcome for B, but 
could not see any alternative. The f17 group seemed too large to sacrifice 
now.

evan 7k*: b should either h3, or g12 to jump out

jl: b h3 would be much too small because the f17 group would likely die.


Mi3ke:  I kind of like the idea of probing at d15, and looking for some kind 
of trade.  the g17 stones look oh, so very heavy.

j14 also helps to settle the shape, if you don't want to trade. 

Upon reflection I think that your move at f13 is actually the best!  But you 
have to follow it up.]
(
;B[fg]BL[733.0]C[jl: I also considered g12, but I was 
afraid that W would make even more territory on the left side. In retrospect, 
g12 would have been better because it goes faster into the open.

Mi3ke:  Nope.  f13 is good shape.  it needs to be followed up at the proper 
time by j14!  although g12 works ok that way too.  f13 is more likely to be 
answered, as it puts more pressure on the invasion at d12.]
;W[lb]WL[1138.0]C[jl: nice tesuji. B cannot 
do L18 because of shortage of liberties after W p18]
;B[qb]BL[624.0]
;W[dh]WL[1089.0]C[ evan 7k*: not sure why b let go of l17 stones. guess it is small 
now

jl: I had no choice!

evan 7k*: d12 is exactly what i whas talking about, build terr while 
attacking weak group, upper left is Huge. nice invasion for b would be b10. 
but, he cant afford it now as f13 still a little weak. afraid b need another 
move there. around j14, etc

jl: evan is again correct here. This confirms that f13 was too slow.

Mi3ke: Actually I like f13.  Watch what happens when black plays j14 after 
the f13 for d12 exchange.  the problem black is facing here happened way 
before f13...   your group got weak back when he failed to establish a base 
by sliding into the corner at d

18 way back when.  It then got weaker when you failed to see the squeeze line 
of play and gave white even more strength.  f13 was not the problem. ]
(
;B[fi]BL[469.0]C[ evan 7k*: this is shockingly gote though. ok. b is now out in the 
safe

Mi3ke:  j14 is a much better way to get out. ]
;W[fk]WL[1067.0]C[ evan 7k*: 
but f11 does littel other than defend. good for w! f9 builds moyo while 
attacking. see the principle?
multipurpose moves

Mi3ke:  f11 doesn't even defend very well.  black is in the open and unlikely 
to die, but there is still some mischief that white could concoct here.  Plus 
it induces f9 which is orders of magnitude better than what white would get 
if black had played j14

 instead of f11.]
(
;B[cp]BL[421.0]C[jl: My f17 group isn't completely safe 
yet, but I couldn't afford to defend once more so I had to invade. I 
hesitated with B c6 which might have been better.

 evan 7k*: w should c5. just allow b to live small in corner

Mi3ke: I agree that c6 is the right move for black.  It will be sacrificed 
but will give black a good leg into the left side. go back for variation.
]
;W[cq]WL[1044.0]C[Mi3ke: c5 is amuch better move for white.  f9 says, "I am 
going to make the side big"  Once you have done that, you *want* the side,

;B[gn]BL[357.0]C[jl: at this point I felt somewhat better but I had still 
two weak groups to care about.

Mi3ke: which is why white should be busy *splitting* them!  with a move like 
h9.  h4 is lukewarm, only attacking one group and not having much effect on 
l4 either.]

;W[di]WL[885.0]C[ evan 7k*: d11 protects c10 cut. n9? j14? notice how these 
moves far away

Mi3ke:  c11 is the proper move, leaving a better endgame situation for white. 
 b8 will now promise the clamp as a followup., something that would not work 
if white played c11 here instead.  study that shape that c11 gives white, it 
is the key to many good

 moves that are hard for the novice to see.

here?

Mi3ke: I prefer g9.  If you  are willing to sacrifice e10 to maintain the  
connection, you can't really go wrong.  back for variation.

you can't necessarily keep the connection but you get a more playable game 
than with h9.]

Well, this is a *huge* move.  Look at the eyeshape for black and white.  see 
the difference if black gets to play this move instead of white.  (Go back

Be wary of second line moves in the opening and middle game... but if one 
affects the eyshape of a group or better yet *two* groups that aren't yet 
settled, it is probably more important than any other move on the board.

Jloup, 

The biggest and most important mistake you made in this game was in your 
fight at the top with the stone at n16.  You leaned on the weak stone instead 
of a strong one.  

Read Ishida, Akira, "Attack and Defense" for a really good decription of how 
to fight well.

This is the next step for you.  

You appear to have understood the struggle to get ahead...  Did you read the 
Kageyama?  

Mostly your problem in this game was little stuff.  Not making quite the 
right decision about where to play, or how deep to penetrate.  Overall, you 
played pretty well, except for a couple of blunders.

Remember the rule about pincering twice in the same direction.   that was the 
only big strategic mistake you made.  Your opponent made a number of them 
which I have commented on.

missed one key lesson from the last game I reviewed for you:  "Never pincer 
twice from the same directio
n"

You got thrown off by your typo into thinking you had to play radically 
differently than in the standard chinese, I suspect.

You don't.  Q10 still acts as a pincer against  r5 albeit a weak one.  The 
standard chinese response of r4 is correct.  \(even more important here.. as 
white adding the extra stone makes certain that q10 will have pincer 
action.\)]
(
;W[oo]WL[865.0]C[Mi3ke:  this move is just what black wants.  

white should instead counter pincer around o3 or attach at r3 to build a base 
and expose the inefficiency of r7.

go back for the variations.

and remember that the key to all of them is that white wants to make the r7 
stone superfluous, by having it add only slightly to an ineffective 
thickness, or capture something that doesn't need capturing.

when your opponent makes a bad move, focus your attention on keeping it that 
way.

I notice that a trick of high dans when they give large handicaps is to make 
lots of vague slightly suboptimal opening moves, then steer the subsequent 
fighting in such a way that those moves become key points.  this is what 
white let's black do for r7 by
 jumping out.]

ing something to expose it for the inefficient move that it is.

pincer stra

k6 is a decent point.... but white has just taken a big concession giving you 
all that secure territory on the left in return for his wall, which you can 
now make nearly worthless.

coupled with white's allowing  black the 4th line terr on the bottom,  
white's still somewhat weak group in the bottom right \(it can't possibly 
die, but is as yet has no eye!\) ... black's reenforcement of q10 with 
r8,r7...  this is about as won a game a
s I've seen this early.  You have a much better feel for the opening than 
your opponent \(even if you do make double pincers:-\)\)

Mi3ke:  I think you were right to defend the corner.  Once you  have extended 
on both sides of the star point, you are ripe for invasion.  I would have 
played at p17 or o16 however, defending \(or partially defending\) the corner 
but giving help to your i
solated stone near white's thickness.  

note: after p17 white cannot invade the corner unless he has nearby forces to 
run to....  q17 and r17 leave less aji, but in this case helping the weak 
stone takes precedence.  

In fact, the one space jump is probably best.  You have a territorial lead... 
if white invades the corner it isn't so bad as long as it is small.

(
;B[le]BL[256.0]C[Mi3ke:  I'm not sure what you are trying to 
accomplish here.

You are leaning on the weak stone.

I suspect you are imitating a peep and surround play that is often seen in 
textbooks and is good style.  

The key to that play is that the peep makes the opponent protect something 
which without the peep would not need protection... and doesn't give his 
stones more liberty, eyeshape, or movement potential.  It's also usually done 
from a stone that is in a pos
ition of strength.  It would be good play if the position facing you from the 
top left were strong black.

m15 makes white stronger, while leaving your stones full of holes and very 
easy to attack.

In general -- do not touch what you want to attack.  You should  instead have 
leaned against white's strong stone at h17 to build thickness for attacking 
n16.

Keep in mind the balance of the score.  Territorially, you are a little ahead 
still.  White has thickness, but here you are given a chance to make yourself 
thick, and don't take it... shame.

see when black defends and white plays e12, black is about 6 points ahead on

think tewari:

If white had played this way without r7 on the board, to then play r7 after

same thing with less aji.

It is essential that you understand *why* r7 would be small.  Basically it 
captures white's stone, which is worth a lot territorially.  the key is that 
for white to move that stone out early he will be creating a very weak group. 
 the harassment and subse
quent thickness created for black will more than compensate for the lost 
territory.  Capturing moves like this are only big early if they help to 
secure one of your groups.  In this case q10 is light, and r4 et. al are 
quite secure without the capture.]

Perhaps I should expand a bit on that "jealous" argument. After all, isn't the one who has the most territory the winner, and therefore destroying one's opponent's territory a good strategy? Well, yes, but go is a game of continuous give and take. In particular, when you invade a moyo, your opponent will, barring any major blunder, invariably gain strength, which will probably result in him getting territory elsewhere.

In practice, this means White's strategy in handicap games is usually to destroy _power_ \(high hcap games\) or be careful to not give the same \(low hcap ones\).]L[nc][fc][cf][cl][jc]

  jloup: I wanted the right side also!
    sxc: if my 3 stones are going to escape ... let them
  jloup: letting you play L14 was terrible mistake
    sxc: it would not be to my advantage to make the 3 stones live
    sxc: yes l14 was a dangerous point
    sxc: but you had to play j2
  jloup: if I play at L14 I still have some hope of playing h13 after
  jloup: the LL corner invasion was a disaster
  jloup: I just weakened my own stones!
    sxc: yes ... you went in the wrong direction

    sxc: yes ... it wan`t so good, but I was sure I could live by playing c18
    sxc: you should have answered b17

    sxc: yes ... that's the risk of playing c12
  jloup: when should I play b17? as answer to b16?
  jloup: do you mean I should have played b17 or answered to your b17 move?

    sxc: no ... what I'm saying is that when I play b17, you usually should play b18 or c18
  jloup: I disagree. c12 is then strongly attacked.
    sxc: but I can then invade the top if you let me play c18

  jloup: I will follow your advice and no longer play c12. I don't master this move.

;W[pb]L[qc][me][jp]C[In my 
opinion, black can play
a, b, or c in this situation.
<a>: simple joseki. shows black's patience.
<b>: presses upper white group and builds moyo on right side.  Changho Lee 
played here in Tongyang Cup title game against Rin.  However, it was after 
black had played Q5.  So playing 'b' right now is a bit early.
<c>:  pretends to builds moyo.  If white plays at D10 or C10, black can play 
at Q5.   However, in most cases, white plays at Q5 \(or less preferably at 
R6\).  If white plays at Q5, it is difficult for black to capture that stone, 
but black expects to get some profit at bottom side, and to play F3 if black 
gets sente.
Overall, I prefer "c" \(your play\) to "a" or "b".  ]
;B[jp];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq]
;W[pl]L[ok][qk]C[Next, black can play either "a" or "b".  I 
prefer "a" as it is better than "b" to attack white group, and most 
importantly, has better chance to get sente. "b" is solid move in the sense 
that it secures black territory on right side more easily, but that territory 
is not that big, and a bit concentrated after white plays R17.  ]
(
;B[qk];W[ol]
;B[ql]C[P9 is better than R8. Whilte P9 is sente \(as black should play 
Q11\), and moves toward center \(black cannot attack white group any more\).]

;B[fp]L[fq]C["a" is 
more popular than F4 here.  F4 is not bad, though, as black bottom right is 
pretty solid.  F4 is a step toward center, and a bit aggressive.  "a" is more 
conservative \(keeps territory\), but can slide toward corner \(D2\) later.  
So, I think both F4 and "a" are good here, but if I were black, I might play 
at !
"a".]
;W[cn];B[fn];W[qc]
;C[jloup: b
 n9 was not very good. f17 probably better.

I agree with you.  If N9 was a sente, black can play "a" or "b"  or R16 
\(very defensive one\).  But I doubt that black N9 can get sente.  If black 
N9 is not a sente, black should have played upper side, which is biggest now. 
 Further, N9 doesn't much expand black bottom territory \(or moyo\).  If I 
were white, I would play O12, and after black P13, at "a"  or K17.]B[mk]L[fc][fd][qd]
;W[nh];B[og];W[ml];B[ll];W[mm];B[lm];W[mo]
;C[jloup: b o6 shoud 
have been at o5.

Yes!!. Absolutely O5.  White cannot play at M6 after black O5 because black 
O8 will capture white two stones.  Black bottom bottom left group is quite 
secure because black has R4.  White N5 was an overplay \(to me\), and if 
black played O5 here, the best moves for white would be O6.  After black M6, 
white can tenuki at F17 or K17.  ]B[nn]
;W[no];B[lo];W[nm];B[lp];W[ln]
;B[kn]C[White gained a lot thanks to black mistake.  Now, white group is almost 
secure, and black bottom is a bit reduced.]
;W[jc]L[cc][fd][df]C[Now, white 
got sente without much weakening left group. Now white conrols the game 
\(Upto this point, I think white is better\).  Now, it's time for black to 
invade or reduce white influence.  I can think of such moves as "a" through 
"c".
<a>: generally speaking, invading 33 when white has two wings \(K17 and C10\) 
is not good, as it allows white to have outward wall \(and territory\), and 
maybe sente.
<b> and <c>: these moves reduce white territory to one side.  I would prefer 
"c" to "b" as it is closer to nearby black stones \(bottom\).  
Suppose black played at "c" and white responded at "b".  Black can  just jump 
to F14, or play at D12, or invade at C8.]
;B[cc]
;W[dc]C[White chose upper 
side.  I think this is correct decision.  If white gets a wall \(while 
allowing black to live in the corner with 5-6 points\), N15 or N14 will 
complete big white territory at upper side, as well as connecting left group 
and upper group.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]
;B[fj]C[The sequence in the upper left corner is pretty standard.  
Fortunately, black got sente, and played F10, which I think is a good \(and 
urgent\) move.  F9 may be an alternative \(a conservative one\), as F10 
induces white at F8.]
;W[fl]
;C[jloup: I also considered playing a, b or c. Any 
of these was problably better than L16.
ychoi: I think L16 is not bad.  Playing at "a" or "c" is good to me, too.  
"b" can be a little dangerous.  There are two important points here.  One is 
somewhere around N14.  Another is G8 \(for black\) or H8 \(for white\) or 
somewhere like that.  White cannot take both places right now, but can take 
them while attacking black.  "b" is farther from other black stones than L16, 
"a" and "c".  It means, it is more profittable, but is more dangerous at the 
same time :\).  \(I tend to play a bit conservative, so you may diagree with 
me\).  If I were black, I would play L16 and expect white K16, black L14. 
]L[je][id][fg]B[kd]
;W[kc]C[White L17 is a definsive move. It allows black to 
press white \(at M16 or K16; I prefer M16\), which in turn enables black to 
attack white left group \(that group is pretty much safe, but not completely 
settled yet\).
The reason I prefer M16 is that, M16 gives me a miai at M17 or J15 \(if white 
takes one, black takes the other\).  ]
;B[jd];W[id];B[jf]
;W[jh]C[White K12 is 
for multi-purposes, but not very effective.  White wants to separate two 
black groups \(one at F10, another at L16\), to attack one of them, and to 
advance white left group to right.  Unfortunately for white, surrounding 
black groups makes it easy for both L16 and F10 stones to escape. ]

;B[gf]L[re][eq]C[By playing at G14, black is ready to live inside

side, another 25 on left side; total 50. \(plus two captured stones\)  Black 
has about 20 on right, 25 at bottom, and 5 at center \(my count is not much

;W[il]C[White J8 is questionable.  It is not 
effective to attack black center group \(which is alive already\).  It cannot

sente.]L[km]

two b groups was likely to die, so I decided to save the bigger one.

IMHO, the bigger one is pretty much alive already \(i.e. even if white plays 
first, it's hard to kill this group\). It has one eye at K15, a gote eye at 
J14 \(black can play at H13, and after white H12, play J13 to get an eye\), 
and black can play either at O16 \(to connect\) or at O18 \(to make an eye\). 
 Anyway, O16 is a good move by itself \(good yose\).  On the other hand, the 
small one is pretty much dead already \(i.e. even if black plays first, it's 
hard to be alive :\).  ]

other hand, black big group is still flexible \(still H13, O18, O15 exist\). ]

Yes :\).  You may want to remember this shape. A15, B15, B16, C16, C17, C18, 
D18 is an alive shape.  B16, C16, C17, C18, D18 is a ko shape \(when all

;W[kf];B[je]
;W[le]C[jloup: I was about to 
resign but lost on time instead... But w would have won even without the 
obvious b blunders in the end.

It didn't matter though :\)  Black lost anyway.  Both black and white made 
mistakes in this game \(as all go players do :\). Except the last blunder, I 
can think of several tactical mistakes by black \(O6, B12, H14, O15, O18, 
K17\).  All of them gave white chances to get extra points or time to play 
tenuki. This kind of things happen everytime in most of go games \(yes, 
including mine\), so I wouldn't say they decided the game.  They were offset 
somehow by white  mistakes :\). O6 was, however, a bit more serious than the 
other ones. Besides psychological impact \(obvious mistake in early phase of 
game\), it gave away to white a chance to play at upper side \(K17\), and 
thereafter, white controlled the game. If black played there first, it should 
be much easier game for black. In terms of fuseki, I felt a little 
uncomfortable with F4 and N9, and most importantly \(to me\), early defensive 
moves \(R9 and R8\) which enabled white to escape without much trouble, and 
to tenuki at!
 other places. So, I would blame R
9, R8, and O6 as bad moves.  I think both black and white should have played 
better if there was no netlag \(I know netlag spoils games a lot\).  Even 
with such a netlag, you \(and white\) played very well except some obvious 
mistakes.

Good luck to your next game !!]

;B[cc]C[jl: b c17 is probably too early. f3 might have been better.


TS: Actually, I'm not sure; the played move might be perfectly ok. If Black plays 'a', White might play 'b', which isn't bad for Black of course, I just dislike mana (mirror) go. A race to the center point would seem to follow.]L[fq][nc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]
;B[fc]L[ed][bd]C[TS: Another option is 'b', although it's hard to say if it's better -- the game changes considerably. See variation B.]
(
;W[ed];B[gb]
;W[db]L[fd][fa][gc]C[TS: White should first play 'a'. If 'b', 'c' is just about sente. If, on the other hand, Black answers 'a' at 'c', then White can play d18 and 'c' becomes a superfluous stone.]
;B[fa];W[cb]
;B[ge]C[TS: 'a' is the vital point, I believe.]L[fd]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[nc]
;B[ob]L[oc][pc][ne][pf]C[TS: One usually plays this move only when Black has a strong position on the right. It might be ok here (though I doubt it), but personally I'd settle for 'd'.


White's next move, 'a', feels like aji-keshi (potential reducing). Cutting a cross with 'b', or playing 'c' threatening the same, seems better. See variation B for an example.]

;B[bf]L[ie][je][id][jc][hf]M[bc][cc][dc]C[jl: b b14 is not good, I misread here (thought that b16 worked after b14).


TS: More importantly, even if it _did_ work (by which I assume JL means that the marked stones escape), it wouldn't be a good idea. Black would then have two weak groups on the board, and White only one - which can easily escape.


One reasonable option would be 'a'.. If 'b', then 'c', 'd', and 'e', after which Black looks pretty safe.]

;W[df];B[bd];W[be];B[ae];W[ce]
;B[af]C[jl: disastrous. I keep giving more prisonners :-(]
;W[ad]C[TS: Pointless. White should just play 'b', isolating Black's center group.

In case you're worried about Black capturing White's stones in the corner, don't be. See variation B, for example.]L[eg][dg]

;B[po]C[jl: I thought I had to maintain the balance of territory and let the weak group look after itself. Of course I was expecting the following W attack.


TS: The main problem here is that by attacking the Black group, White gains actual territory *and* power. This power can then be used to invade Black's moyo.]

;W[cp]L[fi][gh][ih][dq][mp]C[TS: Continuing the harassment of the large group looks like a better idea. For example, 'a' is absolute sente, besides which it eliminates any aji Black has here. When Black connects, 'c' is a nice follow-up move, and is also sente.


Furthermore, an interesting alternative would be 'd', gain sente, then invade at 'e' or thereabouts. A double-attack might be in the offing.]

Besides, I still feel White should play 'b' first. It eliminates weaknesses there and is sente.]L[cn][ih][ao]
;B[nb]C[TS: Black is toying with fire. This is not the main focus of the game.]
;W[mc]C[TS; Equally frivolous. 'a', and by attacking the group White should be able to sequre his moyos and reduce Black's.]L[ih]

;C[jloup: I had decided to play agressively but take some 'cash' \(safe territory\) first,

that's why I played f4 then e3. But it did not work out well because black made
a large lower side.

PG : I would prefer D6 for White but...]W[fp]
;B[gp]C[PG : Most likely, it is a matter of taste rather than anything else but I don't like playing at 'b': it is too inflexible which may turn out to be liability this early in the fuseki.

White does get secure territory but the thickness Black gets in return on the bottom works well with the black stone in the lower right corner.
If White must build thickness immediately, playing at 'a' seems preferable.

Still, it cannot be said that White 'b' is a mistake since the balance of territory and influence is maintained over the board.]L[fo][eq]
(
;W[eq]N[Actual game]
;B[fo];W[ep]
;B[gq]C[PG : Either 'a' or 'b' are possible. 'b' would be consistent with White's intention of playing aggressively. The line given in variation B is joseki.]L[dn][go]
(
;C[jloup: I had planned to cut at 'a' as soon as possible but didn't manage to do it.]L[go]W[dn]N[Actual game]
;C[PG : A black stone at 'a' and a white stone at 'b' would complete the joseki in the lower left. After the black tenuki, White could play 'c' and start a fight with good prospects.


Black's move is not without merit: if White had been allowed to play a stone at 'b', a white pincer would then severely restrain the black stone at F17.]AB[fc]L[jq][cj][kq]
;N[Actual game]W[id]C[PG : I am fond of this move myself but would be hard put to justify it: pincers are usually made when an extension has allready been played on the other side. There is no need for White to fear Black claiming the upperside: the Black position will be thin and open to invasion if necessary.

Now, if Black simply jumps in the corner, and White follows the usual joseki \(as happened in the game\), Black will retain sente.

On the other hand, if White simply extends down the side, Black ends up having played on two sides and White only on one: White may be falling behind in the overall balance of influence.

Variation B is a common alternative.]
(
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
;C[jloup: the joseki is at 'a', b13 does not look good. what's the best way for W to take
advantage of this?


PG : Black 'a' and White 'b' are indeed the usual continuation; Black then has sente to play elsewhere.

Black B13 is a mistake: it is too low and has little potential for growth. White can probably tenuki and refrain from defending at 'b' \('b' remains an excellent move none the less, fixing White's shape\).

Playing at 'c' as in the game may be aji keshi. White could keep a sequence as shown in variation B in reserve for later.]L[cf][fd][ce]B[bg]
(
;N[Actual game]W[ce]
;B[be]
;L[nc][kq][kp][qj]C[PG : 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are also possible. Approaching the corner from the open side is correct. Variation B is an interesting continuation that could mix things up.]W[qn]
(
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq]
;L[qj][lq]C[PG : A sound move but inconsistent. White should extend to 'a' before Black plays in that area. White can later aim at 'b'.]W[fd]
;L[qk]C[PG : As mentionned in the previous comment, Black should attack by playing a move somewhere around 'a'. If White then approaches the upper right corner at 'b', variation B is a nice continuation. The white position at the top will still be open to invasion.


As it is, M17 is a move which should have induced F16; the opposite happened here.]B[lc]
(
;L[qj][qk][qc]C[PG : This could be an overplay and Black should answer by pincering since there is allready a black stone at M17. R14 would be better at 'a' or 'b'. Unless, Black defends immediately which is unlikely, White can always jump in at 'c' later in the game.]N[Actual game]W[qf]
;L[nc]C[PG : A pincer is theoritacally appropriate since this move only strengthens White and hardly protects the corner. After this move, Black still needs to add a stone at the top around 'a': in other words, an immediate attack could backfire on Black.]B[qe]
;L[qh][pj]C[PG: If White is worried about being pincered, playing 'a' and then 'b' may be feasible instead.]W[pf]
;M[qn][rp]L[qk][qj][qi][ql]C[jloup: at this point I did not like my position.


PG : It seems like it is not too late to get the right idea but R12 is too close to the white stones to be effective. I would prefer attacking the marked stones first since White can answer R12 at 'a' or 'b' and get good shape. Extending to 'c' on the other hand, after Black 'a' or 'd' would give White an overconcentrated position.]B[qh]
(
;W[od]N[Actual game]C[PG : This feels wrong and I would say it is aji keshi. White should leave the top alone for now and concentrate on the right side by playing at 'a' or 'b'. Both the white and black marked stones should be able to get out safely to the center. White could then use his stones to support an invasion of the top.

The sequence that was played kills the aji at 'c' and 'd'. White has forced Black to take territory...]L[qj][qk][qc][nc]
;B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[nd];B[nc];W[qj];B[oh]
;W[ng]C[PG : 'a' is good shape and serves the same purpose. Playing too close to Black will strenghten him and allow him to turn on R10.]L[nf]
;B[ri]C[PG : Prevents White from connecting underneath. 'a' may also be possible \(variations B and C\).]L[rj]
(
;W[rj]N[Actual game]
;L[rf]B[rg]C[PG : Not a good move. It does not secure an eye for Black and by inviting White to descend to 'a', Black weakens his corner territory.]
;W[rf]
;L[ni][ql]C[PG : I would prefer 'a' to leave the possibility of an invasion at 'b' open.]B[pj]
;L[pk]C[jloup: w r11 turned out to be a bad mistake, causing shortage of liberties.


PG : I guess White is trying to kill which may be unreasonnable. Simply playing 'a' is enough. If Black can be chased far enough in the center, along with the white stones that separate him from the top, White will be in a good position to invade the bottom.]W[qi]
;B[pi];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[ol]
;M[pf][qf][rf][pe][od][nd][ng]L[qk]C[jloup: it is painful to push once more, but this was needed to protect the cut at 'a'.

;C[jloup: the result is disastrous for w. question for the reviewer: how should w have played
to avoid this?

PG : Indeed, the situation is starting to look hopeless. Black should now move out to the center with 'a' or 'b' putting pressure on the marked white stones. If Black can then push again in sente to 'c' od 'd', he will be in an excellent position to attack the white stone at D10.]W[dj]

Exactly when such a sequence should be initiated is another matter. Playing it too soon may not be good: Black has played two stones on the 4-4 points and is well placed to negate any thickness White would get in the center.

;W[ef]C[PG : This move is not recommended by professionals. That's about all I can say for sure. Still, I often play this move myself.

Jumping in the corner is correct. \(Variations B, C & D.\) Black gets mighty influence at the top but White comes out of this with territory and sente. A fair trade in principle; White must keep cool and not rush Black. The objective in this area should later be to play lightly and merely reduce. As long as White does not overplay, he can hope to reestablish the balance of territory and influence when Black later approaches White's corners.

One last remark, F14 is possible if White intends to play a center game: the white stone at R5 can readily serve this purpose.]
(
;B[fd];W[di]
;B[cd]C[PG : This is a mistake as White can now settle himself easily. Variation B shows the usual continuation which is almost a joseki.]
(
;W[ci]C[PG : This move may be a little too tight but I don't know what the correct shape is here.]
;B[pj]C[PG : Setting up a moyo. It is hard to say if this is correct though. With is next move, White seems to set up his own moyo on a grander scale and may be taking control of the game. An approach move at 'a' or 'b', or 'c' if Black wants to stress the bottom area, is perhaps preferable. But then again maybe this is just a question of style.]L[pq][fq][op]
;W[pq];B[fq]
;W[cn]C[PG : A move at 'a' seems preferable as it is both a pincer and an extension. C6 is too conservative. It White is firm in his intention of building up the right side, 'b', 'c', or 'd' show more ambition.]L[jq][dn][fo][fp]
;B[dr]
;W[cq]C[PG : I feel the corner is small at this point; White could still try to play a pincer around 'a'. Either the right side or the bottom side territories could then start expanding nicely. Variation B is one of the joseki starting with 'a'.]L[hq]
(
;B[iq]
;L[qf][nc][nd][hd][qc][kq]C[PG : This seems correct. In the same situation, I would personnaly consider other moves also at 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e' but I would be hard put to justify any one of them in particular.


Approaching on the right side does have the advantage of pressuring the lone black stone a Q10. This is probably the soundest strategy.


Jumping in the corner is interesting as long as White can get sente and pursue with reducing maneuvers. 'e' could also be one stone to the left or one stone lower ifWhite wishes to emphasize one side or the other.


There is a big point left around 'f'. Further play should take this into consideration.]W[pf]
;B[nd]
;L[qd][qm]C[PG : This may be a little premature. White should probably settle his stone at Q14 before by playing at 'a'. If Black later extends down the side to 'b', White can aim at extending left on the bottom side. Variation B is one possibility.]W[ql]

Anyways, the situation in the center is still not settled and White's tenuki may prove foolhardy. Black should keep the pressure up with 'a'. He can then aim at sealing the top and building a vast center moyo.

There is also a weakness at 'b' to consider.]W[mq]
;L[ii][en]C[PG : Too slow. Black doesn't gain much by playing here and helps White consolidate his left side. Again, by first initiating and attack with 'a', Black can then gain leverage to launch a deeper invasion or reduction of the left side.

I think the weak point to consider for immediate play would be 'b'.]B[fo]

;L[qf][qn]C[PG : Since Black still needs another move at 'a' to make territory out of the right side, it may be preferable to start a fight with 'b' instead of Q8. This should allow Black to reduce the lower right corner as things develop.

Black's zone of inluence. One problem I see with Q2 is that P2 will later be 
sente for White.


In any case, playing this way \(that is securing the corner area and letting 
White get outside influence\) is not to my liking : the Black stone at K4 has 
lost most of its meaning.

Black a satisfactory result considering his initial position.]B[pr]

up a ladder but also seems to be aji-keshi. I would prefer to see the ladder 
be set up later on by starting a fight around D16.]B[jj]

It's been severly weakened. A W invasion at the bottom

to strengthen around F5. I'm seeing invasion points
near G3, K4 and D3. W can always play B4 but B can
concede a small life in the corner.]

;B[gd]C[I think that at this point you need a plan. Are you going to let
black live on a small scale - and presumably take sente? Or
do you need to attack him severely - higher risk, bits might
drop off. Can you protect your weakness around M17 while you
are doing so. Will reducing B centre/bottom do or will an 
invasion be needed?

The only way to decide (rather than intuit) is
to count. I almost never do this ;-(

Lets map out a plausible denoument if you let him live ...
B has about 15 on the right. 30 left + corner, should be
no more than 10 at the top if he lives. How big can the
bottom get then? Well W might get 20 top left, 12 bottom
right, the top's hard to count but assuming he's playing to
let B live so he gets 30. That means that if B gets 15 or
so at the bottom he probably wins, so even third line
terretory there will be enough.

My conclusion: You MUST get sente or kill B. reduction and
standard jose won't do.]
;W[ed]
;B[ff]C[So far so good; You've solidified a corner. B has
effectively "reduced an area that wasn't really
yours to begin with. I don't see a really strong attack
on the B group, but that's not surprising, it was a
shallow reduction from a strong position. 

Rememberig the plan, W still has sente. Could he now
invade the lower side? I think so. But there's a weakness
around M17. So perhaps another move or so here is
in order.

In the actual game W get's into one of those frustrating
sequences where plausible sente moves are ignored for
just long enough to reduce their effect.]

After F16 almost certainly, but F16 for W will allow

that the best you can hope for is a semi-sente move
at K14. So now is the last chance for the invasion.

There are two drawbacks to this attachment:  \(1\)  Black's corner is too small to justify \(2\) White's settling his group so easily.  Compared to the tsukenobi joseki from hoshi, Black has at least four points less.

Rather than answer directly, though, I'd probably later kakari at 'c' and aim at a slide to 'g'.  \(It's not clear whether this is the best way to deal with the Black moyo.  Any 7-dans have an opinion?\)


Back to the right side. . . .  Consider the exchange made in the lower right:  White has at least 10 points \(plus a great extension/approach to 'i' or 'j' if he grabs sente\), Black maybe 20 points when he plays 'a' and takes gote; this doesn't seem bad for White.

MG:  Black has to look after the life of his group: 'c' looks interesting.


Because of the marked stones, Black should be _very_ careful about invading inside or near the line between F3 and N5 \(just a rough guide, but playing within requires careful reading\).  You might consider something like 'd'.


Also, the D13/14 stones are quite strong and you don't want to approach them too closely.  A play at 'b' demands a response at 'e' or 'f'.  Normally the appropriate extension toward such strength is 'g', but then White will probably invade at the 3-3 point.


As Black, I'd play 'e'.  If White answers at 'h', closing the corner at 'i' is huge \(settling the left side comes next\).]

at any cost. It is much more profitable to let the opponent live small and take the

fight.


Another lesson is that the status of attacker and defender can change very quickly

after a single mistake. This occured several times in this game. Fortunately for W,

B stayed in a defensive mood although he had several occasions to kill on a very
large scale.

    of the time a knight's move \('a' here\). In this context B could also

jloup: B c13 was very big before, but now it is less effective; there
isn't much territory to be made now on the left side. If W answers by jumping
at 'f', then c13 does not achieve much and the potential B territory in
the center is quite reduced.

If you want to keep your center moyo strategy, play 'a' instead and let W live
in gote as you did for the right side. Then attack at 'b' to punish W for not

jloup: Good decision.


What can we learn from this game? B has kept for a long time his 4 stones advantage

by playing thick \(except in the lower left, where B played too thinly\). This is good,

keep this style. However, the thickness must be put to use at some point, either by

attacking or by making territory. B had a magnificent moyo in the center which B let

go to waste. In several occasions B played a small local move instead of looking at

the global picture. B n4 was the worst of such moves. So the main lesson of this game

could be "think globally, don't get yourself always tied to local fights, keep looking
for the big points".


W made a good game considering the difficulty of giving a 4 stones handicap, and
played very well in the end. Congratulations!]

 rich 23k*: good game chris, thanks


And I resigned the game here.  My invasions failed and there is no way my center moyo could compete with his top (seems his bottom and my left similar size)


Rob- This was a good place to resign. A few notes: Try to concentrate a bit more on the actual status of your groups. Don't make moves to support groups that aren't really weak.  This type of thinking will keep you from getting behind in the first 50 to 75 moves..Gotta make sure to get your share of the big points. 


Stop at  several points to count. Maybe move 50 and move 100. Perhaps more frequently if you don't feel you have a handle on what the status of the game is. I realize that it isn't easy to guess what your thickness or the enemy's thickness is worth, but give it a shot. The important thing is to know when you have to invade (because you are behind), and when to grab some points or solidify. 


I should clarify: When behind, you can (obviously) catch up by invading or by taking big points..Building thickness (like m4) isn't so good at that point, because it is too long term, and requires sente (For a moyo builder like p10 or so..), which your opponent may not grant you. :)


This was a better game to comment, as your opponent, chris, played well.. For the most part, you played fine, just realize that a few slow moves at the beginning can kill you. That's why you see those strong players often taking a long time in the fuseki.. They know that fighting is great, but if your opponent is the same strength, you can't always win fighting from a disadvantage.. Sorry about the length of these comments, happy going! :)]

Comments by Jim Mattson.

My general comments are:
 1\) Don't be afraid to sacrifice a few stones to your advantage.
    Trying to save them all will cost you.
 2\) Don't be so cautious about ataris.  I think you're at that
    stage where you've learned not to make every atari you see,
    but now you are avoiding some ataris that are the right move.
 3\) Your opening and end game are very good.  Concentrate now on 
    middle game tactics, tesuji, ko fights, and life-and-death 
    issues.]US[Brought to you by

;W[dg]C[I would be tempted to play the standard kakari against the corner 
stone at `a' or `b.'

This move seems like a ``halfway'' move in two respects.  It is a weak attack 
against

the corner stone, and it is a weak defense for the marked stone.  Because of 
the height 

\(fourth line rather than third line\), this two space extension doesn't 
bring you out of
danger.]L[cf][df]M[dj]
;B[fe]C[This seems like an odd reply, and probably 
merits some punishment, such as `a' or `b.'

;W[po]C[This shimari is quite valuable, and I think the 
right one to make, in keeping with
your center emphasis.]
;B[jp]
;W[pj]C[I think this is the wrong direction, 
though.  A point like `a' is very appealing, as

an extension from your shimari.  I pick `a' over `b,' because it undercuts 
black.  Even if

the invasion around `c' becomes impossible, a slide to `d' can still do some 
damage.]L[lq][lp][gp][jr]
;B[mp]C[Black takes the fertile ground in front of 
the shimari, but I think this stone would
be better placed a line lower, at `a.']L[mq]
;C[When b has a double wing 
formation the c3 invasion is called for, right?


This is certainly a reasonable invasion in this position, but with the long 
extension

on the bottom, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of splitting black up with 
a stone 

at `a' or `b' instead.  \(The situation is much like the corner in a high 
handicap game\).  

With the 3-3 invasion, you can expect black to block at `c.'  The usual 
joseki ends with 

black getting a nice territorial framework in the lower left quadrant.  \(See 
variation.\)]W[cq]L[fq][fp][dq]

;L[km][lq][lp][mq]C[I think you should save this cut for 
later.  You can also cut at `a,' and it's

not yet clear which is better.  On the other hand, if you used this 
opportunity

to attack the lower group \(perhaps `b' works, with miai of `c' and `d'\), 
black's
position might collapse completely.]W[ll]

that followed cost me dearly.  I think I should have pressed in front of b's 
wall at
K10 \(a\), strengthening my marked stones in the process.


However, if you do not play either here or at `b', black plays `b,' and he is 
out.

I _think_ `b' is a better choice.  Expect black to cut, and then sacrifice 
and squeeze,
so the middle black group gets cut off with only one eye.

Also, consider snaring the two black stones on the right with a move like 
`c.']W[fk]

move by black, though it gives you sente.]B[gg]

felt this was an important juncture of the game.  I was looking for a way to
reduce b's huge potential area and increase mine.  This looked like a good

Several things seem bigger:  \(a\) defend your upper right corner at `a,' 
\(b\)
snare those worrisome black stones on the right with `b,' or \(c\) attack the

lower black group with `c.'  However, I think `c' needs to wait until your 
marked
stones are out of danger.  Stabilizing your right center allows you to attack
either at `c,' or perhaps even as far into the top area as `d,' so it might be

the biggest move.  However, expect black to come out of the ensuing struggle 
with
sente, and he will probably invade your upper right corner.]W[mf]

nothing else left.]B[ef]

The w group on the right is still weak and subject to attack.

dane \(after game\): Was D15 too small?  Is there really any threat to life of D17 by C12?
Other moves might be K4, K16 \(to threaten a link with M11\), or C8.]W[de]
;B[ck]
;C[Personally, I don't think so. F7 does not gain much although it definitely asserts center game for w. Joseki at O4 might be better. you'd like to get the lower edge and then use it to strengthen the w group on the right

dane \(after game\):  Here I was trying to confine C12-9 to edge.  Is this right thinking?]W[fm]

;C[I think J17 could be ignored for now. It is a good move for b. Consider the difference if w plays at K17 instead. 

G17 might be better, then jump to G15 with B J15. G17 now gives too much to b if he plays into G17.


O3 is probably acceptable, but I think O4 might be preferable to M4. M4 is a bit too far for my taste. O4 assersts center game as well as serve to settle the w group on the right.

I tried to stress what I belief is the most important handicap
of players of black's strength. Since geek plans to share this
review with daveg as well, I also commented on the white moves
once in a while.

-- Jan van der Steen (jansteen@cwi.nl)
]
;W[qf]
;B[nd]C[Good and positive move. Other options are one of the O-ba
points like A and B.]L[dj][jp]
;W[cn]C[With this move white tries to prevent black from making a
san-rensei position \(three star points in a row\). A good strategy
in a handicap game.]
;B[fp]M[dd][nd]C[Again, a good and positive move. However, since the marked
stone is on the board, black might feel tempted to try something like
diagram 1 as well.]
(
;W[fc]
;B[df]L[jc]C[Compared to the previous two corners, I would now suggest
a pincer around A. One of the reasons is that it would make good shape
in the upper-right. Another reason is that the usual move by white
\(the 3,3 point\) does not turn out well for white \(please see the
following diagram\).]
(
;W[pm]C[White plays a good fuseki \(opening\). Taking a foothold on
various parts of the board preventing black from creating a moyo \(large
framework of territory\). Still there is no reason for black to be
worried, the games seems fairly balanced \(for a handicap 4 game that is\).]
;B[qj]C[
Positive move: separating the white position into two seperate
groups. One remark: when playing such a splitting move it's
usually better to play the move one line higher \(at Q10\).
First of all, all black stones are in high positions so it works
together better with these previously played stones.
But also, a stone on the fourth line is saver itself.
In the subsequent fighting the marked black stone might easily
become weak itself.
Of course, it will be more difficult to do *real killing* because
white can always slide underneath that stone \(S10\), but killing
should never be the aim while attacking the opponent.
]M[qj]
;W[np]C[Good, taking the initiative in the lower-right corner.]
;B[oo]C[Good approach: seperating the white stones again. Personally,
I would have choosen A though, although that doesn't imply that the
text move is inferior.]L[no]
;W[qq]C[The normal approach in these circumstances, entering san-san
tries to settle one of white's stones, taking away black's base. The
other white stone will have to take care of itself.]
;B[qp]C[Probably the correct direction, although A is tempting too,
see diagram 4.]
(
;W[pq];B[no]
;W[op]C[The vital point in this shape, good.]
;B[pn]C[Too timid, better play hane at A, preparing the cut at B.
If white blocks at C, black defends at D, and the cut at E is defended
while the cut at B still exists.]L[rq][oq][rr][rp][po]
;W[rp]C[Vital point again, stressing the lack of liberties of the
two black stones.]M[qp][pp]
;B[ro];W[mo]
;B[mp]C[Good spirit! But taking one stone at A is huge as well since
it would: 1. make black alive, 2. threaten to cut at B, 3. take a
lot of profit. The move at A looks so small and slow but the longer
you look at that move, the larger it seems to become :-\)]L[rq][oq]
;W[rq]C[White makes his group alive, while aiming at the cut at A.
Now it's not so clear anymore who is cutting who in the center.]L[qo]
;B[mq]C[Just for the record: in this shape you should also consider
the shape in diagram 5.]
(
;W[nr]C[
 queue 17k*: n2 ]
;B[qe]C[Yes, queue is right, n2 is sente and big. There is no
difference in liberties though, after white answers with A.
Anyway, leaving the position like this \(with R15\) is a thin
way of playing. White has all kind of nasty attacking options in
the lower-right. Black's shape needs attention here.]L[nq]
;W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[so]C[Black has a shape problem here. The two marked white stones
are working well. The normal move at A might loose two black stones
either on r7 or n4.]M[pm][mo]L[nn]
;B[mn]C[How about diagram 6 instead?]
(
;W[lo];B[nm]
;W[om]C[It's hard to comment on such fights, because actually you
have to read out most variations quite deep \(this might sometimes
involve some 20 move sequences\). But one alternative way of playing
would be diagram 7.]
(
;B[nn]
;W[ok]C[Especially in a handicap game moving these stones immediately
is very interesting way to play.]
;B[km];W[jo]
;B[rk]C[This move is not necessary so black looses an important tempo
here. Keypoint is A now \(to prevent white from playing there\).]L[pi]
;W[nj]
;B[pf]C[Good, taking a firm grip on black's stone.]
;W[kk]C[Good, vital point for attack. Black suddenly feels thin around
here. Thin also in the sense of *not round* \(flat\).]
;B[ml]C[I can imagine that you were worried about white A, but playing
from the inside like this is very painful. it's important to realise
that black can sacrifice the two marked stones \(with B for example\).
The center is top priority in this game \(in most handicap games\).]L[lm][kn]
;W[lj];B[im];W[ho]
;B[gm]C[Considered A? This should be your first impression in this
position. Therefore, I might tend to let white play B instead of the
marked move, taking a firm grip on the lower side while aiming at
C or D \(both to separate the black positions\) later on.]L[gn][iq][hn][go]M[ho]
;W[fo];B[gp]
;W[go]C[This move at A is big as well.]L[hp]

again, did black consider A instead of the marked shape?]L[en]M[em]

;W[br];B[er];W[iq];B[hp];W[jp];B[jq];W[kq];B[jr]
;W[kr]C[White is succesful in the lower side fighting. White entered
the lower-left corner, and besides captured two black stones.
Besides, white can later peep at A, B, and C, so black doesn't have
a lot of center strength in return.]L[jl][hl][fl]
;B[jc]C[A sound decision I think. Aiming at the marked group from
a distance while taking territory.]M[pm][om][ok][nj][lj][kk]
;W[pg];B[pi];W[of];B[pe]
;W[qh]C[Heavy and might even be an overplay as well.
I would prefer to just play A. Settling in the center would enable
white to start an attack on the whole black center group.]L[nh]

;C[Final comments:
A very nice game to comment on, full of interesting fighting
and played by two players with a positive attitude to Go. Black
used his handicap stones to fight, which shows a good sense of
efficiency. The black player should try to learn to recognise
kikashi stones and deal with them as such: I want to see him to
give them away next time.
The white player showed a good sense of direction \(especially
in the opening stages\). Later on \(in the center fight\) he
didn't play patient enough \(while dealing with his weak center
group\).  Both players showed a good basic knowledge of Go and
shapes in general.

more territory.

I'd be honored if you'd comment on this game I played today.  There 
are three areas I'm particularly interested in:  The opening \(first 50 
moves or so\), whether white's attack against black in upper right could 
have been successful \(obviously it *could* have, but try to pick optimal 
play for both sides\), and whether white could have lived on lower side.

else you'd like.]W[dq]

a handicap game is to cut Black into many pieces

opposite. White is relatively safe but has 5 groups
to make live independently; Black is potentially one
or two groups! I think White needs to allow Black to
take more corner territory and build center influence
instead.]

 white to invade the right side above. Since white is solid on the bottom black 

 shouldn't expect white to answer at a\) here though. The left side is also quite

 slightly vulnerable stones on the board. ]M[dn][dp][cq]

 Another point is that the move has little effect on the solid white stones. The 

 reverse of 'don't touch weak stones' is: 'play against strong stones'. Black doesn't

 mind white adding stones to his already solid formations, so it would be more 
 interesting to play either of the marked attachments.]L[ql][qk][pj][oi][nf][op]

kkkken: It looked like F5 was aiming to make territory on the left
side, but I don't feel it put enough pressure on F3 to have much
chance of success ?

This is a little unusual.  Normally black plays D6, followed by 
W K4, or W D2, B C3, W J3.  Then
black plays around K 16 to make abig moyo.

But the strategy with the
Chinese style opeining is to haveW come in to the left side
and get an attack.  This move
invites W to invade at C6, and
attacking the weak group
there wins the game for B,
so F5 is pretty effective in the
end.]B[fo]

D2 \(your play\) is better.  If

;C[You need to defend on this
side now, but this move doesn't
work well.  E9 is better.

Remember to stay away from
strong stones.  The F5

The result in this corner
shows a common mistake.  You

make another group weaker.

kkkken: Maybe I should have B7 instead of B9?

Yes!  After W b7, B a7, W c7
you are connected, and black
must play around B4 or you
capture some stones \(starting
with w b5\) and live.  So
B7 connects in sente.

This is why running with the P5 stone \(ie move at O5\) was a mistake.
Might have been better to reduce with something like L4 instead of O5.

Or, P7 followed by R14, trading your side for his bottom, might be reasonable.

Something else that cries out is the area around G5.

The game looked pretty even. As overall comments, it looks like you \(TerryT\) need to

improve you reading skills, but don't we all :\)? I guess the only other advice 

I have is that you should give your plans a chance. By this I mean if you go for

a corner \(for example\) don't change your mind halfway through. Be a bit bolder.

It looked like many of your invasions were not deep enough to be effective, and

some extensions could have been further. On the plus side, it seems like you have

;C[A final general comment:

   I think you need to learn to offer more tradeoffs to your opponent, so
that either way he/she plays, you win something and he/she wins something.
Much of Go seems to be orchestrating these tradeoffs.  For example, you
can often kill a group only after making an approach move which if
properly replied to just gives you a little extension to some existing
territory; but if your opponent decides you have extended too far and
cuts you off, they suddenly find their larger group in trouble.
   Or, as in this game in the last variation, where you could have forced
black to choose between connecting to either of two of your otherwise
dead groups.
   You thought up and played out a few very nice sequences in the course
of the game.

Cheers,
Mike S.

kkkken: now this move \(e8\) seems wrong to me.  perhaps h6?
        it seems I have little to fear from w connecting these weak
        stones, none of which seem to have much eye potential.

 TT: The basic strategy behind this move is good, since black is ahead
 he should think safety first. Strictly speaking if black wants to play
 this way it is better to omit the exchange of the marked stones and just 
 play a\) - that would leave the ko in the corner for later. The problem is 
 now that white can't actually connect the two stones. Black will cut
 through the keima at a\), and he can answer both the kosumi a\) and the

 attachment b\) with  the played move. If black wants to attack c\) looks best:
 it threatens d\) or e\). Alternatives to this are f\) and g\). ]B[el]M[cn][bo]

Should be at K18. When you play the San Ren Sei, you are trying to
make a big moyo.  M17 allows white to reduce your moyo easily. Let
white live with a few points on the side, while you get the upper
right corner and a nice position in the upper left.]B[lc]
;W[lb];B[kc];W[jb];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc]
;C[
Bad shape. This move makes an empty triangle, and doesn't really
accomplish anything. The three black stones in the upper center are
already connected. It would be better to take a big point elsewhere,
like D10. You have the potential to make thickness across the top, and
D10 will work well with it. It also reduces the value of the lower
left corner for your opponent.]B[jc]

;W[hb];B[eb];W[ga];B[ec]
;C[
By not playing D10 earlier, you have built thickness across the top,
but it doesn't work because of the white stones at D10 and C14 To
catch up, you will have to find some way to use that thick position.]W[cf]
;C[
This only makes white stronger. White as approached close to your
thick position.  Rather than trying to make territory, attack white by
playing C12.  C15 gets you maybe 12 points of territory, but white
gets almost that much after D14. By invading, you can get a little in
the corner, while reducing white's territory rather than increasing it.]B[ce]
;W[df]
;C[
I don't understand this move. What were you trying to accomplish? The
white stones on the top are alive, and there are plenty of big points
to play.  F3 might be interesting. If white pincers, you can play C3,
and if white responds in the corner, you can extend to J3 and kill any
potential territory on the bottom. There are several other
possiblilities, too. White has a moyo, but very little actual
territory. You have solid territory. It might be best to just play a
straight territorial game. O14 may be the losing move.]B[nf]
;C[Now white has a Big moyo.]W[jq]
;C[
When your opponent's moyo is bigger than yours, play to reduce it. If
yours is bigger play to make it bigger. His moyo is bigger than yours
right now. If white gets E4 you the game will be very difficult for you.]B[ql]
;C[Wrong side. This lets you play in the middle of the moyo at E4.]W[op]
;C[Good. This is your last chance to invade before the moyo becomes territory.]B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[cn]
;C[
H3 is better. J3 just forces white white to make the K3 stone
stronger. F7 might be even better than H3. It escapes into the center,
and white almost has to defend at D8. Then maybe you can invade at N3.
After F7/D8, white has about 40 points on the left, about 15 on the
bottom right, and maybe 10 on the top, for a ltotal of about 65. You
have about 20 in the upper right, and about 12 in the upper left, and
a couple of points on the bottom side, totaling maybe 35, so you are
30 points behind. If you invade at N3, maybe you can push the K3 stone
towards your thickness on the top and make some territory on the right
side while attacking it, or else reduce white's bottom left territory.
You are behind on points, so you need to do something.]B[iq]
;W[jp];B[ip]
;W[jo]C[Now the bottom right is pretty much white territory, while all
you got was life on the bottom.]
;B[gm]C[Too late. The bottom group is pretty secure, so no need to run
into the center now. Better to invade on the left side, maybe at C8.
If you think it is important to extend into the center here, F7 is
better shape. It works well with the stones around F4.]

;W[er]
;C[This looks slow. S6 is a big point, and you may want to  play
B5 as a forcing move  later, if you get to invade at C8. Forcing now
removes that potential and doesn't really get you anything.]B[do]
;W[co];B[fj];W[dl]
;B[em]C[Too slow. It doesn't get you anything, and isn't forcing. You
need to be making territory somewhere. O7 or S6 look big. Now you can
see why F7 was better shape before.]
;W[fo];B[mo];W[mq];B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[pp];B[pn];W[dn]
;B[eo]C[
Better to sacrifice the stones at D5 and E4. It is only 4 point and
white is strong there anyway Play G5 to connect to the G7 stone or
just take the G2 stone and make life. You already made a profit the
right side. The empty triangle is bad shape.]

These stones are already alive by just taking G2. It would be better
to make territory on the right side with N7 or S6 or something on the
right side.]
;W[il];B[hl];W[jk];B[ij];W[nn]
;B[jj]C[
O7 would be better. Your main territory is on the right side. Because
of the stone at D14, the center is small. You can only make a few
points there.]
;W[nm]C[
After this move, you don't have much chance. White has 45 in the lower
right, about 45 on the left and 10 on the top, for about 100 points.
You have about 15 in the upper left, maybe 40 on the right, so you
need to get about 45-50 in the middle, and that isn't going to be possible.]

 I am mainly concerned with the opening.  I think I got behind in the opening
somewhere, but managed to overcome my opponent because I was tactically
better in general. I seem to have a lot of trouble with the opening, and
am often finding myself having to fight to regain ground lost early. 
I think my opponents pincer in the lower right corner early on was bad,
but I think I bungled the lower left somehow.
 Anyway, I'm only concerned up until around move 56 or so.

Thanks, David.

Hi David, Sure, no problem. But let's make this the last game, ok? Not
because I don't like to analyse your games, but for both of us it's good
to see other people's games/analyses as well I think. This game contained
again some interesting teaching material. I hope I could shed some light
on the questions you might have had while you played the game.

Kind regards, Jan van der Steen.]

attacking move is 'b', black 'a', white 'c'.]W[oh]

making a nice wall, or starting a big fight.]W[qq]

an opportunity to pincer and
extend from the upper left,
perhaps to K16.]B[pf]

;C[J17 is another alternative.

the white stones, so white
is more likely to answer,
and you can keep sente.]B[hd]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[oh];B[me];W[md];B[ng];W[ni]
;C[this move doesn't surround white yet, and starts a wall facing
a white position, so perhaps just

;C[good move.  White gets a big

;B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[pp]
;C[This move doesn't do much.
Forcing white out here only
weakens the black group below.

;W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[le];W[ke];B[lk]

he will not be pushing W toward

getting some eye space.

Better to just live here
since running out will give W
territory on the left side.]B[eo]
;W[gp]
;C[Now would be a great time
to curl around W at D6 since
he ignored your attachment.
W won't waste a move at H3 to capture one stone,
so you can always pull it out later.

Playing at D6 could give you a
large territory on the left side.]B[hq]
;W[gq]
;C[If you want to save these, try
playing at J2.  This threatens
to connect to the right with K1
\(not L1, which can be cut\),
or to play G2, connecting to
the left.]B[hr]
;W[gr]
;C[This move does not connect.
Most pairs of knight's moves
on the edge can be cut by 
sacrificing in one to
cut the other.

For example, WM1,m2,l2,
L1,J1,K2,J2,K3,K4,N1,
J3 captures 3 stones with sente.

Or WL1,L2,K2,M1,J1 Ko.]B[js]
;C[This helps black connect.

How about WK2, L1,J1,
J2,M1 to capture lots
of B stones.

The key is to sacrifice one
stone on one side to cut the
other.  Keep reading till you
find one that works.  There
are several here.]W[ir]

D9, taking more territory,
and threatening F10 as
a followup, or extending
to C12, for even more
territory.]W[ck]
;C[W is alive already, so you
should be concerned about
strengthening you left group.
How about B G7, W H7, B H8,
W J7, B J8 to save your
group and keep W cut from his right side group.]B[jm]
;W[im]
;C[This cut is not so good.
Playing on the outside is 
better at J8, or how about
K9 first, then W K10,
B J8, W H7, B G9 and you
are connected.  If W
doesn't connect to the top,
you can cut around L13,

get the last big point at C12.]B[in]

Walls of 3 or preferably 4 in length are much safer than walls of only length 2,
because they give you less trouble when they are cut.


The best defense is often an attack, especially when fighting off an invasion or

encroachment of your intended territory.  Try to threaten to cut off the attacking stones,
unless they can live even if cut off.

When you leave behind a cutting point or other weakness, try to catalog it
in your mind so that you realize what the opponent can do to capitalize on
your potential weaknesses.

Look for moves that allow you to make threats in two directions at once.]W[tt]

commenting later\).  Still unsure of its value.  getting away with it so far.

I don't know a lot of josekis -- but, at least locally, this looks like an
eminently reasonable move -- and it seems to be moving it the right direction,
towards your shimari in the lower right.]

;B[qj]C[This move doesn't feel right to me -- but its hard to describe why.  If you want to
play on this side, it should probably be on the 4th line.


I think even more, I would prefer an extension along the bottom -- the choosing

of the high \(5/4 rather than 5/3\) shimari in the lower right emphasizes influence

along the lower side, so an extension to K4 \(or, maybe, K3\) would be nice.  Another
nice choice might the kakari at F3 -- and play to build strength towards your
shimari.  \(Attach and extend would be fine if white chooses -- if white plays

a one point jump something like D2, W C3, then J3 is possible or even a matching

one point jump into the centre -- if white pincers a counter pincer would be a nice
choice.\)]

gets you out farther, faster, and it is light.  This makes for white territory, and
black heaviness.]
;W[id]
;B[he]C[is this too slow?  Should I d18 now? or maybe g14 or something 
faster?


You are correct this is too slow/too heavy.  D18 is grubbing for life -- that can

wait, you do want to keep moving out.  F15 is nice shape, F14 might be possible

\(not normally, but the H16 stone has to be worth _something_\).  G14 isn't bad either.

But, remember, you don't have to connect all your stones -- you can afford to let
on or two drop off the edges to keep the rest connected and together.]
;W[df]
;B[dk]C[Very dangerous choice here.  You already have one weak group at the top, creating a

second weak group in close proximity is only asking for trouble, and a dead group.

You are giving white the perfect oppurtunity to make a splitting attack with chances
to kill either one -- or definitely take profit.


If you must play a stone on this side, 3rd line is probably better than fourth -- and

points to play at are C6 \(normal kakari\) or C12 \(weak point of the white one point
jump like this.\)


But the move D14 puts more pressure on your \(weak\) top group -- take care of it first,

before trying another invasion.  Something simple like J15 will help immensely -- then
follow up with another jump into the centre, or maybe a hane at K14 if white
plays the expected response of K15.]
;W[cm];B[ch];W[ec];B[fd]
;W[fg]C[White plays a severe attacking move...]
;B[lp]C[And black tenukis????


Essentially you gave up the upper side right here, and came close to giving up the 

left side as well.  The status of black's two weak groups is the most important thing

on the board right now.  You must do something about them -- I think H13 is probably
best -- but J15 is also a possibility.


One group or the other can live by stealing, or threatening to steal,  the base

from white's corner group -- but in doing so, it will so strengthen white that the other
group, if it hasn't escaped yet, is almost sure to die.]
;W[gq]C[Of course, this move should be in the upper left as well...

But, even locally, this isn't right -- it is too small/slow.  Black can
still invade at the 3/3 point \(C3\) and live \(I don't think this even gives
a ko.\)   Far better to increase the size of the influence by jumping towards
the centre -- K6 \(conservative\) or K7 \(better\).  Because this is loose --
in both the K6 and K7 cases -- the choice of K7 looks better because it
is faster and larger.  The jump out also helps to reduce the potential
growth of the black moyo on the right.]
;B[nf]C[Locally, a good move -- builds nicely on the black moyo, and it threatens nastinesses like
O17 to the white group, but yadayada-UL-yadayada.]
;W[nd]C[White needs a move here, somewhere, but something like M14 is probably better -- it helps

a little with the weakness of the connection between M16 and P16, but more importantly
it is another barrier between the black H15 group and rescue.]
;B[ko]C[I don't think I would play this now.  Need to play on top to connect 
with my weak group and simultaneously attack white upper group. \(though it's 
not weak\)


As you have probably noticed -- I've been saying this for quite a while now. :-\)]
;W[jo]
;B[kn]C[Can I hane instead?


Maybe, but I wouldn't.  This is more solid -- probably a better choice.  If you hane,
the white cut could get messy.]
;W[ie]C[Variations show other response than black H14 -- more comments on H14 with the move.]
(
;B[hf]C[This move is too heavy, and too slow.  You are fighting inside white's influence, you

have to be make light, flexible, moves.  Be willing to give up some stones to get life

for others.  Something like H13 if you're trying to stay connected is better -- or 

J13, allowing white to capture small \(as shown in the variations on the previous move\)

also gives black a nice result.   And, even when cut off, these black stones still have

a lot of aji -- the play at C17 -- threatening to either live, or connect to the black
F17 group is still available.


\(See variation 1, in case you aren't familiar with the connection sequence.\)]
(
;W[di]C[White proceeds to execute a beautiful leaning attack on the left side black group,

in preperation for capturing the black upper group on a large basis.  This is very
nice play by white.]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[dh];B[bf];W[bd];B[bl]
;C[Black should not respond to this unless he feels that it threatens his life.  If black

ignores, I don't think white can kill -- the exact determination of this is left as an
excercise to the student. :-\)


In fact, all the further moves in this corner are, unless they threaten to change the

life status of this group, too small compared to the unresolved centre situation.]W[ek]
;B[dl];W[dm]
;B[bm]C[I bet this wasn't needed.  My side group seems fine now.  Perhaps I can yet 
rescue my upper left stones had I not thrown this gote move.

As I noted a couple of moves ago, both players have played a couple more moves
here than they should have.]
;W[jj]C[This move by white is probably too aggressive/greedy, there is too much space between

it and the white group at J16 -- black might be able to force his way out through that

gap, though this is the right area to be playing in -- on the border between the black
and white moyo.  I think I would prefer K11, or maybe K12.

>arg.  I should reply now at m10?  my ul grp is dying.  I wonder if I saw 
>that when I was playing?


Yes, your UL group is dieing, but it isn't dead yet.  One of J14, K13, or J12 would
be very interesting continuations -- especially J12.]
;B[bo]C[>surely I have better things to do.  My moyo is in serious danger, this group 
>is alive \(W & B\) and I piddle around down south :\(


This isn't small -- it is actually medium sized, but it isn't immediate, and more
importantly, it gives up on an invasion at C3/C4 \(or maybe D4\).]
;W[bp]
;B[pc]C[>Same comment as before.  I am ignoring a huge threat to my biggest 
>territorial potential and the ul group's life!  If I ignore center, I should 
>at least try to make life for my unsettled grp rather than quibble with 
>settled ones over territory.

This one is even smaller than the previous -- it was probably reasonable for
white to respond in the LL, but he shouldn't \(and won't\) respond here.]
;W[lj]C[Any move in this area is both big and important -- even this jump towards black helps

to make the capture of the black upper group more solid, but I would prefer a play

at K12 -- this makes the walling in absolute, and it leaves white with two very good

follow ups -- either K7 to complete his own moyo, or if black plays inwards on that,

side a reducing move in blacks moyo -- any of P10, O10, P11, and O11 look nice --
with the forcing move of P13 as a follow up.]
;B[nj]C[Black is kind of stuck now -- he no longer has much hope of rescuing his UL group, 

and with this reduction by white, his moyo -- though big -- won't amount to enough.

O10 is probably the best of a bad situation.]
;W[jn]
;C[This should be at N8 -- as we see from white's moves, the hole at N9 is glaring -- whereas

the play at N8 covers this hole.  It does leave a similar hole on the other side between

N8 and L6, but black is much stronger on that side -- so he can stave off a penetration 

far more effectively -- or use the defense to setup up for a counter move into white's

sphere of influence.  If nothing else, fighting on the stronger side gives black far more

chance of ending the local fight in sente -- which can be quite important.  In fact white 
may choose a less agressive push just to retain sente.]B[ll]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[ml];B[om]
;W[mn]C[ fmaus 24k : Go?  or this invasion" :\)


Properly speaking, this isn't an invasion -- it's a reduction.  An invasion is where a stone

is placed in the oppenents influence with a connection to life -- white is clearly connected
throughout this sequence.]
;B[no];W[km]
;C[Connecting or not with this stone is fairly small, and definitely gote -- the escape at

E8 is far bigger, and thoroughly sente.  Your escape does threaten to capture the white
stone at N6, but this is relatively small.]B[lm]
;W[el];B[me];W[md]
;B[mh]C[This feels too conservative for the situation -- I think you have to try to use the aji

of the dead group more -- moves to look at include K14 and K15, with thoughts about the
peep at L11 -- probably not as the initial move, but as a follow up to it.]
;W[kh]
;B[if]C[Too late.  Rather than push then pincer as you played -- try K14 \(threat to connect\) --
you are one row deeper that way.]
;W[jf]
;B[kf]C[
 hchen 23k*: are u experiencing some net lag?]
;W[jg]
;B[ih]C[This black group is dead -- playing more stones isn't going to help it, so you should

be playing big/sente plays elsewhere.  L8 is reasonably important, and O18 is quite 
large.]
;W[kl]
;B[mm]C[This is small, gote, and as you notice later -- it doesn't work either.]
;W[mj]C[White is worried about the pushing sequence starting with M9, cutting off too many stones,

or breaking in to the territory.   But white can always give up the two stones at N9 and

N8 rather than letting black in -- so this move is too small at this point -- a move around
P17/P18 is big, as would be L3, C5, and a move around C15/B15. 


As to why I suggest C15 -- consider the variations I start at variation 1 -- if black
plays C17.]
(
;C[E18 isn't going to work -- black can't get enough eye space.  The play of C17 \(as 

followed by variations on the previous move\) is far more interesting, and is definitely
blacks best hope here.]B[eb]

only, while White got major influence after killing the Black center group, 
in the area where Black's influence should have been.  When Black killed 
White's left side group he got material compensation, but ended in gote with 
no influence.]

;C[was r10 proper?  I could have shimari'd here, but then there's no

he invade near my stronger side?

R10 is the right direction, and the right general area.  But, with your
thickness along the bottom, you should probably play high on this side to
continue building influence, so I would have picked Q10 rather than R10.

I agree that neither shimari looks to be worth making.]W[qo]

black wants it, and it doesn't move out quickly enough.  A far better choice would be

being cut off, O6 covers the cut, and allows white to move farther out.]W[on]

course, with this white \(invasion happy\), F16 might be a better choice.]
;C[White has invaded a bunch, but this one seems riskiest.  Is it?  

This is a severe overplay by white.  A far better choice, available since
black made the error of playing on the 3rd line, is the capping play at
F15 \(a\).


If White were thick/strong along the bottom, he might be able to get away with this

play.  That is if he already a stone somewhere around D13/D14.  Even so, this stone
should probably be used as a sacrifice for further reduction.]W[hd]L[fe]

yourself un-needed cutting points.  The simple one-point jump to F15 \(mark\) is correct.

;W[he]
;B[hf]C[Again, too aggressive -- if you let white run straight up, where is he going to escape to?

He is just running towards your thickness at the bottom.  By doing this you give white

cutting points that would allow him to escape.  Maintain the pressure with a simple 

extension to G14.  \(Remember, white has stones on the left side of the board, the ladders
on that side will be in his favour.\)]

 \(ladder not going to work, so what's best way to deal?

Yes.  Play solid, if you can't ladder -- don't start.  The simple extension
of K12 makes your H13/H14 stones look a lot better, and makes whites stone
look very unhealthy.  It also gives you the ladder the other way should it
be needed.  \(And that ladder works.\)]B[kh]

Yes, this invasion does work, but not, as you played it.  White's shape
here is awful, with cutting points all over the place.  I'll show a proper

sequence as a variation on white's next move.  In general -- when you see a mess like

this look for a sequence of ataris which end up in, a double atari, a situation where

the other player can't connect due to shortage of liberties, or a situation where you 
create an internal cutting group with more liberties than a cut of piece.

;W[op]C[Jared: I was foolishly imagining a black move around D16 followed by white R5, then retaining sente and then playing an approach to D16.  I guess I am trying too hard to keep black from making a shimari.


Usually you only make an early approach like this if you have a friendly stone in the corner behind you.  This gives B a good combination extension and pincer.


Your move at P16 is biased toward the upper side, since when B comes in to the upper right corner you will get an outside wall facing left.  Given your move at P16, the upper left corner is importnat for you.  So just play there now.]
;B[lp]C[Jared: I think white 6 should be at P6, and I ghuess black will end in sente allowing black to play first around D16.  I guess this is ok.

You should probably answer this.  P6 or Q7 are OK.  After P6,
R6, p8, R8, R3, S2, Q3, R2, you

have given B territory in exchange for a wall and should attack the stone at M4 with a move around K4.  This attack would be more

effective if the D4 stone was white, so the move at P6 might give up too much teritory.

Q7 is a way to live quickly without giving up too much.  You can
look up the joseki...]
;W[cd]
;B[oo]C[Jared:  I think this is awful for white.  Black will gain a ton of power by attacking my eyeless stones.

Correct.  This move should be at Q7 \(or P6, or even R5\).]
;W[no]
;B[pp]C[Better to play Q5.  It still threatens to cut at O4, but doesn't leave the atari at P6 behind.]
;W[on]C[Good.  Force an empty triangle right away.]
;B[po];W[mp];B[nn]
;W[mn]C[This move is not good.  Forcing Bto extend at O7 is just what he wants, and gives him the start of a big territory.  When you find yourself pushing someone from behind and giving him territory, try to think of something better.]
;B[nm];W[lo]
;B[kp]C[The last two W moves make a false eye, and give B a start on territory on the right.  You want to avoid moves like N6 if you can since you force B to mave at O7, which is good for him.

Perhaps your move at N4 could
have been at O4, then if B O6,

play M5, L5, M6, and you are threatening to capture the stone at o6, or cut at L4.


Or, since B didn't respond directly to N4, after he cuts at O6, you could play M5 right away \(since the N6, O6 exchange is bad for W.  If B responds to M5 at L4, you could try P7, then attack the B stone in the center.]
;W[oq]
;B[mq]C[Jared: I probably can't afford to play R16. I 
probably have to N7 as painful as it may be.


N7 is another example of pushing from behind.  Don't do it unless it is the only way to survive.  Even M8 is better.]
;W[qd]
;B[qi]C[Jared:  But black lets me N7 
anyway...


B wants you to play N7, since it forces him to extend at O8, making a big territory.  You should be trying to figure out how to reduce that territory, not solidify it.  Perhaps a move like Q9 or Q10is possible.


R11 is a great move for B since it extends in front of your shimari and makes a good moyo.]

L5, black K5, white K6. ]

This move works out better than
either of these sequences, so it's not so bad.

B is winning since W gave him that big area on the right.  W's invasion in the bottom didn't hurt him much since he secured the corner.

B can't cut at F9 now, so there is no big hurry to defend it at E9.]

you to review the attached game, please.
My igs name is vlk and I am white in the game. Thank you.

Sure, my pleasure. It became quite a lot of comments, partly
because I was fascinated by the fighting in this game. IGS
6k* is quite something! It's hard to point out general mistakes
because both of you played so well. So I concentrated on
specific variations and ideas. I hope I touched the right

Now we're back to a normal position locally. This result is

This is one of those really difficult type of questions -- I really don't
know the answer, I can only give my feelings.

First, I think one of your own shimaris, probably the UR one, is bigger than
this kakari.

As to worries about the pincer reducing the value of your shimari, should
you kakari on the lower left -- this shouldn't be a worry.  If he pincers,
make a counter-pincer that also happens to be an extension from your shimari.
In fact, you should be happy with this, as it gives you a chance to extend.
If he doesn't pincer -- then you get influence extending towards your shimari,
either way, you should be happy.]

This move is very bad -- it encourages the potentially heavy black stones at F17

White is making the black group thick in order to gain a couple points of territory.

;B[pf]C[> A 1 kyu in Paolo Alto said this type of move \( I played something

In a handicap game, the corner stone was probably on the 4th line, and the 

knight's move up to the 5th line.  In that case, it does allow for an invasion,
but it still isn't entirely unreasonable.


In this case, I don't think the invasion underneath is a problem -- the 3,4 stone
makes that more difficult.


But, I still don't think it is the right move for black -- in this situation, black

has thickness to the left, the move that stands out to me is a pincer of the white

stone, while simultaneously making the extension.  In the opening, if you can find

a move that simultaneously does two things, it is very often a good move.  \(Usually

this is pincer & extension -- though it can be extension&extension, or extension and

kakari.  An extension and extension example is the third stone of the san-ren-sai,
which is an extension from both corner stones.\)

So I would play a move around M16 myself.


\(I'm not saying this response to the kakari is inherently bad, just that there is

a better response here because of the surrounding situation.  In general, it looks

like a reasonable response to this kakari.  The best way to check this is to find

a joseki book that discusses 3/4 josekis, and look to see if this is shown as a
resonse to the kakari in question.  I think it will be.\)]

It is a good idea -- but too late.  Once you've resonded at Q14, you seem
to have given up on taking influence towards your wall, in favour of influence
towards the right side.  Also, this is just doesn't look like it works with 
your wall on the left.

More normal, I think, is S17, Q17, S15, then white makes an extension along
the upper side.  Of course, this "normal" sequence is part of the reason that
black probably doesn't want to make the Q14 response initially -- it doesn't
work well with his stones at F17.

This is not a good way to play,  white totally removes any of the "threat to
connect" aji available here -- that could help make an invastion of the left
side \(or top\) live.   As I've already mentioned -- I think black should have

This stone should not be cuttable -- this shape is actually considerred quite
solid, and quite good.  One point farther, and you might have had a shot at 
cutting.  This is why L12 should have been played near hear.

These decision of cut vs block are always difficult -- sometimes one starts
to cut, in an effort to build thickness for a counter invasion, sometimes one
just plays elsewhere, because any local move is now too small.  At this point,
I think the choices are H14 \(to block\) or on of C6/F3.]

The push here is a good idea -- even the push and cut, but your followup isn't
correct.  Normally, you can cut some white stones, depending on the situation,
but white has gotten some extra plays in, and that effects things.


The score on the board right now is VERY close -- by a quick count I got 107 for

Actually, the proper move is the throw-in at F1.  This reduces the liberties on the

white stones by one, then the hane at J1 is atari.  After F1, white plays F2 \(atari\),

then black plays J1 \(atari\), white plays G2 \(connection\) and black goes back and connects

at J2 or K2.  This throw in is often the solution to properly dealing with monkey-jumps.]

Hi again. Here is another game I would like reviewed. I play
white and thought I had an early lead, but then found myself ten
points behind, and only won it back through my opponents blunder.
My big question is with the opening.
I felt he made some mistakes that I failed to take advantage of.
It started out as a moyo game ... or so it looked to be, and I
am always nervous with those. So, you can restrict your commentary
to the beginning of the game mostly, since that is what I am really
interested in. Thanks.

Hi,

When I replayed this game I noticed that both of you missed the
keypoints in the center a few times. In this kind of moyo oriented
games the center power is all deciding. The player who controls the
center controls the game. Please remember that in the next moyo game
and you will do much better. Good luck.

Jan van der Steen.
]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd]
;W[co]M[dd]L[cj]C[
A usual way to try to discourage black from building a moyo along
the upper edge. The reason is that the marked black stone doesn't
feel to develop anymore in the direction of 'a', since white [c5\]
is very solid towards that direction.
]
;B[nq]M[pd]L[dq][qn]C[
This move at 'a' is definitely big as well. When approaching the
lower right hoshi stone, the move at 'b' seems more natural because
it's both a kakari and an extension of the marked stone in the
upper right.
]
;W[jq]M[jq][co]L[eq][cq][hq]C[
When white creates the marked shape, he should realise that black
can invade later on at 'a', making miai of 'b' or 'c' next.
]
;B[qn]
;W[pn]C[
Always hard which side to play. White usually will play on the
stronger stone to attack the weaker one later on. That would suggest
the move played.
]
;B[pm];W[on];B[qq];W[qo];B[qm];W[pq];B[pr]
;W[or]C[
This is not so good for white. Correct moves are either 'a' (diagram
1) or 'b' (diagram 2).
]
(
;B[qr];W[oq]
;B[ro]L[nr]C[
This is not so good because black's stones work very efficiently
here. Besides, white's territory is still very open, so the marked
black stone will still be able to move (starting with 'a' for example).
]
;W[dq]M[nq]L[om]C[
The keypoint for power is 'a'. That point would flatten black and
give white's moyo more body. Besides, it would make moving the
marked black stone less attractive.
]
;B[jd]L[om]C[
Likewise, black's keypoint here is 'a'.
]
;W[om]C[
Good.
]
;B[ol];W[nl]
;B[nk]L[ok][pl][oj]C[
Unnecessarily forceful. It allows white to start a fight with 'a',
'b', 'c'. Usual shape here would be just 'a'.
]
;W[mk]L[ml][ok][pl][oj]C[
Better shape is stretching to 'a'. When black would defend 'b'
next, then white has sente. When black keeps on pushing, white
cuts at 'b', black 'c', and fights with 'd'.
]
;B[ml];W[nm]
;B[nj]L[mj][ni][ok]C[
Bad shape because a white push at 'a' is sente again (because of
'b'). Better shape is 'c'.
]
;W[ll]L[mj][qf][re][qc]C[
Better push at 'a' and keep on pushing once or twice more. Next
invade at 'b', 'c' or 'd' as you like.
]
;B[mj]C[
Right, black's moyo looks better than white's suddenly.
]
;W[mm]L[lk]C[
Better connect at 'a', that stone would be more useful later on
while fighting inside the black moyo.
]
;B[qg]L[qc][qe][qi][og][mg]C[
Not good because it leaves the invasion at 'a'. A much better point
to protect the side is 'b' (double purpose). When white would invade
next at [r13\] black would fight with 'c', white 'd', black 'e'.
]
;W[lj]M[mm]L[lk]C[
Here you see another reason why the marked stone should have been
at 'a': this hane would have been more powerful in that case.
]
;B[cj]L[li]C[
Black should play at 'a', the keypoint for center power.
]
;W[lh]C[
Very good!
]
;B[kk]L[li][kj][kh]C[
Probably not good because black looses the aji at 'a' (aiming to
cut either at 'b' or 'c' next.
]
;W[kj]L[li][ki][mi][kh]C[
White should just connect. When black would play 'a' next, then
white would play 'b', black 'c', white 'd'. This fight is ok for
white because a black cut at [l10\] would be gote (not atari).
]
;B[jk]L[lk]C[
Making the kikashi stone heavy which is bad because it can't be
sacrificed anymore like that. Better to either cut at 'a' (consequent,
but slightly overplay), or leave the scene completely by invading
somewhere at the bottom for example.
]
;W[dk]M[kk][jk]L[lk]C[
Just connecting at 'a' is more than enough here. This would make
the two marked black stones useless.
]
;B[lk]C[
Black cuts in sente. This turns the tables in the center quite
a bit. Suddenly it's a fair fight.
]
;W[ml];B[jj]
;W[ji]L[jh]C[
Better shape would be 'a'. Now black can play 'a' himself, putting
white in serious trouble.
]
;B[ii];W[jh];B[hj];W[ih];B[hh]
;W[mi]L[ok][nh][ph][qh]C[
This uses the aji at 'a' too soon maybe. For example, maybe later
on white would prefer to have this stone at 'b' (also sente) instead.
Or, when the white group would live later on white would prefer
to use the aji to start trouble with 'c', or 'd'.
]
;B[oi]L[pk]C[
Better on 'a' I think.
]
;W[ik]L[ij][hg]C[
This is a bad move. When black answers with 'a', white 'b' lost
impact on black's shape.
]
;B[hk]C[
Difficult, probably also ok.
]
;W[il]C[
Too heavy and aji keshi as well.
]
;B[ij];W[jm];B[ck];W[dl]
;B[bm]L[dj]C[
A move at 'a' seems more important.
]
;W[cl]L[dj][cm][bl]C[
Bad, better push at 'a'. Omitting white [c8\] would leave a move
at 'b' or 'c' for later.
]
;B[bl];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[nc];W[sd]
;B[gm]L[jf][if]C[
After having invaded at (3,3) an attack starting with 'a' or 'b'
looks serious now.
]
;W[hl]L[gl]C[
The same comments as for [c8\]. This move is bad style, you spoil
the better style move at 'a'.
]
;B[gl]
;W[gi]L[fk][fh][ch][hg][ke]C[
White is loosing here. Maybe peep at 'a' and 'b' next (making miai
of 'c' and 'd') would make your opponent nervous. When black answers
at 'd', you play kikashi at 'e' to strengthen this group and aim
to play 'c'.
]

 Saving the two stones was definitely not the
 best move.  The corner is still up for grabs,
 and black will get a share whoever makes the
 first move.   The urgent move at this point
 is to prevent white's potential moyo from 
 being realized.]
;W[nc]C[ The same reasoning applies to white.  
 At this point, building the moyo is
 the high profit strategy.  It's almost
 there!   Given black's passive responses
 up to this point, someting like "a" might
 win everything.  
 
 White did well to avoid sealing with "b",
 since black's potential inroad is fairly 
 small. \(BTW, on first viewing, I thought
 "b" was a good idea - so remember, I'm
 not that much stronger than you that you
 can always trust my judgements!\)]L[nj][ej]

 with the white group secure, the big territory
 still in doubt is the moyo.  Get to it!  This
 kind of error is where weaker players get taken
 to the cleaners by marginally stronger players;
 the local tactics are sound, but the big move
 is elsewhere.]

;B[rc]C[ in retrospect, an 
obviously useless move.  what is the best point to 
 reduse white center moyo?
 
 At this point, the groups are all safe, 
 so black's move is a straight territory
 play, worth only 10 points or so, and gote
 at that.  Earlier it was a much bigger move.
 
 The moyo has been begging for attention
 from either player since about move 100.
 The obvious building and reducing moves,
 the ones you \(plural\) eventually used,
 are good ones.]

 Generally speaking, black is too concerned with making
 live groups, and so is making heavy, over concentrated
 groups.  In some sense you have to take it on faith that
 there will be eyes, as long as you still have plenty 
 of running room.
 
 You both are playing reasonable tactics most of the
 time \(with occasional lapses\) with the biggest problem
 is seeing the big picture, making the globally big move
 rather than a tactically correct but much smaller move.
 
 Consider that several times you eventually made the
 "right" move, but only after some preliminary dithering
 elsewhere.  It's largely a matter of luck which player
 noticed the bigger move first.]

After this both players played fairly well, but White kept paying for the early mistake, having more weaknesses and being one step behind, while Black was strong all over and really didn't have much to worry about.]

;C[The black constellation is one of the most popular beside
san-ren-sei \(three hoshi stones in a row\). White can deal with this
opening type in two ways:

 1. invade the upper edge \[a\]
 2. build a constellation himself \[b\].

Nowadays, professionals choose for the invasion at \[a\]. In the Edo
era \(Honinbo Shusaku\) and even still in the beginning of this
century \(Go Seigen\), the move at \[b\] was seen too frequently.

Please refer to the variation for the normal procedure in this position.
]B[qe]L[ed][co]
(
;L[lc][fc][ed]C[Although unusual, this move can't be bad. This stone will
extend to either \[a\] or \[b\] and thus settle itself conveniently.
Establishing a save group here prevents black from creating a moyo
\(potential territory\).

However, most contemporary professionals play the kakari at \[c\]
instead, so probably they consider this move a little slow. ]W[ic]
;B[kc]
;L[ec][gc]C[This seems a normal move. It would also have been possible
to play at \[a\], although this may lead to immediate fighting after
black \[b\]. ]W[fc]
;C[The normal answer to white's marked move \[f17\] would be
\[a\]. Although it is a rather small shimari it is a very efficient
move combines three purposes:

 1. making territory
 2. attacking the white group
 3. prevents being enclosed like with \[b\] \(see variation\)

These kind of multi-purpose moves are most important in Go. ]B[do]L[dc][cf]M[fc]
(
;W[co]C[This move is the most normal response to the black kakari.
]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq]
;C[An interesting move. Black takes this important point and
lets the three stones on the left edge fight for themselves. ]B[dc]
;L[dk][dj][di]C[It's obvious that since black played tenuki, white should
consider an attacking move somewhere in this neighbourhood. The moves
which seem candidates are: \[a\], \[b\], \[c\] and the move actually
played \(\[C11\]\).

In my opinion it takes a professional to be able to decide what is
the best way to proceed in this position. Therefore I looked up the
position in my Go game database and was lucky to find a professional
game containing exactly this position \(see variation\). \(By the
way, the database hit also tells us that this position still satisfies
professional standards :\). ]W[ci]
(
;L[ck][cf]C[Black could decide to make a small extension to \[a\] \(for
white \[b\]\). Playing the pincer at \[C13\] shows good spirit. ]B[cg]
;L[ei][ck][dk]C[One should feel a little reluctant to play right in the direction
of the three black stones. I would like to give some alternatives:

The first idea is to jump right into the centre with \[a\]. I have
always been taught by my \(patient\) sensei that while being attacked
ikken-tobi should be the first move to consider.

Another idea is to play \[b\], keeping a little distance from the
black stones. This move makes good shape to create eyes if necessary
while also preventing that black occupies this point creating some
eye space for himself.

The final move to consider is \[c\], a move which is lighter than
\[b\]. It also keeps some distance from the black stones, but has
the additional feature that it moves to the centre more rapidly. ]W[cl]
;L[op][qj]C[It's hard to agree with this move. First of all it's not urgent
to play here. Next, it shifts from the actual battle field \(lower-left\).
And finally, it's not the largest move either \(black \[a\] or \[b\]
would be larger\). ]B[ke]
;C[A relaxed and good answer. Strengthening the white group indirectly
helps white on the left side, and provides backup strength for actions
in the upper-right corner later on. But meanwhile realise that this
doesn't imply that actions in the upper-right corner should be sought,
they even might never happen. ]W[ie]
;L[go][gn][bj]C[A bad move since it will strengthen the rather weak white
group. The normal direction of movement after white \[C8\] would be
to jump to the centre with \[a\] or \[b\]. After having jumped black
could seek the opportunity to attack the group \(by removing the eyes
with \[c\] for example\).]B[dk]
;W[dl];B[el]
;L[bn][ek]C[My first reaction when I saw this move was: "strange, can't
be a good move in any sense" \(sorry Jim :\). But, once I started
to think of it, it *does* have some interesting features. First of
all it connects the two stones with the stone at \[C11\]. Next, it
intends to connect with \[a\]. And finally, it prepares for the cut
at \[b\]. ]W[bm]
;L[bn]C[Black can hardly fight with \[a\]. White will play \[e7\]
and the black group will be weaker than the white group, making the
fight unreasonable.]B[em]
;C[This result is not bad for white since he got rid of the weak
group by connecting it, enlarging his corner territory in the mean
time, and the black group in the centre is not thickness \(although
not really weak either\). ]W[bn]
;B[di]
;C[A big move. ]W[qj]
;L[oq][op]C[Preventing a shimari with either \[a\] or \[b\] might be bigger.
]B[lq]
;L[nq][pq]C[Good, no need for \[a\] which would leave corner weaknesses
at \[b\] and \[P3\]. ]W[oq]
;L[qh][ql]C[A move at \[a\] seems larger: it extends the moyo and prepares
an invasion at \[b\]. Black shouldn't worry too much about the stone
at \[M3\]. The stone is quite difficult to attack efficiently. Another
reason to prefer \[a\] instead of \[J3\] is that the latter move doesn't
have any effects on white's position on the left since the white corner
is extremely solid. ]B[iq]
;L[qd][qc][pb][mc]C[This move is very large since it also helps white when black
would decide to enter white's right side. Besides, it will help white
to invade the black moyo in the upper-right. Moves like \[a\], \[b\],
\[c\] and \[d\] are possible ways to start the invasion. ]W[qg]
;C[Normally a kikashi, but in this position \(with W\[b6\]\)
it's not, strictly spoken. ]B[ep]

(
;B[nq]C[The tremendous advantage which black has in this fight is
that black has one weak group \(\[o3\],\[o4\]\) while white has two
\(\[n4\]-\[n5\] and \[p3\]\). The black stone at \[m3\] is not weak
since it's light, i.e. not a lot of damage imposed on black in the
event that it would be captured by white. ]

black to play the perfect splitting move at \[o5\]. But things already

connect all black stones, leaving the three white stones \(\[n3\]-\[n5\]\)

The direction is wrong since the left group is weaker than the corner.
So maybe white \[a\] or \[b\] instead would be better. Remember: always
play from the weaker group \(and if it's too weak just try to find
an appropriate way to get rid of it \).

That would have given white perfect shape: see "perfect shape". By

could also make a shimari with "a" for example.

 Question: Is this good?

 Answer: Compared to a move on the 4th line, this
move leaves more space for invading. The virtue of a higher move could 
be to have some effect in the center or along the right edge, but
not in this position, so it's not a good move. It is hard to find
a better move though. For example: "a" would make the marked stone
inefficient. Maybe \(I'm not sure\) white should try to play like
in "seeking efficiency"

move is aji-keshi, it erases other good options.

;L[cq]C[White decides that the lower-edge is bigger than defending
the corner but since black "A" is annoying I would probably play
it  myself now.

;C[White had two weak groups inside black's moyo now. Black is
doing fine in this opening.
]B[cq]
;C[It's not easy to find a move for white along the left side,
although I feel that's more urgent than invading the right corner.
]W[pq]
;C[Good idea, seperating white's groups.]B[oq]
;L[or]C[Vulgar style, normal would be "A". The reason is that white
bumps with his "head" into the black stone at Q5. This means that
this chain will have problems because of lack of liberties later on.

 Question: Is it time to do something like f16?

 Question: Is this too small?

 Answer: The balance of power in the center demands
you to play "a". With "a" you can aim to cut white with "b", so it
gives you good prospects, while keeping your positions strong.

a rather small gain.

The first thing to note in this position is that all black
stones are high. High stones are useful for attack, but not quite
useful for territory. So black should try to keep white's groups
weak to enable the black handicap stones to do their work.

Another application of high stones is to build up a large framework (moyo).
This can  be one of the things black could do while attacking white
stones/groups.

;B[rf]C[
This move seems too concerned with the upper-right corner.
The lower-right is bigger now. The black player shouldn't fear a white
move at r17, this will loose some territory, but weaken the outside
white group at the same time.

White gets one of his follow-up shapes (one of r12's follow-ups).

White plays very thick again. Actually white could switch
somewhere else, since the group seems to be able to take care of itself.
However, when it is "extra-thick" it can be used to attack or as
back-up  for invasions around r6 for example.
]
;B[pm]C[
This move shows that black is worried about an invasion here. The
shape made with q7 is slightly "nurui" though. "Nurui" is  Japanese
Go jargon for a move which is "flesh nor fish". It tries to do two
things at the same time, but does both poorly/half. Better moves are
shown in variation "Hard to find" and "Hard to play".

Black is still worried about the p17 stone, but shouldn't
be. The corner is alive, so moving p17 is only endgame value. This
means however, that m18 is also only endgame value. Slightly small
in this stage.

a pincer around A. One of the reasons is that it would make good shape

following diagram\).]

various parts of the board preventing black from creating a moyo \(large

;B[qj]C[
Positive move: separating the white position into two seperate
groups. One remark: when playing such a splitting move it's
usually better to play the move one line higher \(at Q10\).
First of all, all black stones are in high positions so it works
together better with these previously played stones.
But also, a stone on the fourth line is saver itself.
In the subsequent fighting the marked black stone might easily
become weak itself.
Of course, it will be more difficult to do *real killing* because
white can always slide underneath that stone \(S10\), but killing
should never be the aim while attacking the opponent.

A very nice game to comment on, full of interesting fighting
and played by two players with a positive attitude to Go. Black
used his handicap stones to fight, which shows a good sense of
efficiency. The black player should try to learn to recognise
kikashi stones and deal with them as such: I want to see him to
give them away next time.
The white player showed a good sense of direction \(especially
in the opening stages\). Later on \(in the center fight\) he
didn't play patient enough \(while dealing with his weak center
group\).  Both players showed a good basic knowledge of Go and
shapes in general.

This is the game, thanks very much for agreeing to go over it.  While
I was playing, I thought my play typical, though I played quickly.

Had I taken some time, I wouldn't have played so poorly later in the
game on the lower left side.  However, my habit of quickly giving
way when I think I have lost an attack is typical, even when I take
time to actually read stuff out.  yucao was watching the game, so
some comments are directed at him via kibitz, while others \("oops"

Hi Clyde,

I concentrated on the mistakes which I think could improve your game
most once you'd correct them. Hope that I covered the questions you
had after you played the game.

Happy holidays to you too (also from Kishiko)!

;L[rq][pk][pi][qh]C[One point strikes as especially big here: "a". It has three
meanings:

  1. ensures a base for your group;
  2. it undermines the opponents base;
  3. the territorial value is about 20 points.

In response to "a", white needs to defend the right side  \(probably
with "b"\). So you will  still have a chance to play d10. Also note
that "b" doesn't defend  the right side completely. Later you will
have opportunities to invade at "c" or "d". ]B[dj]

Dear Kishiko,

Here is a recent 10/15 game from IGS. I played white and managed to
win, but black let me of the hook with slow moves a few times. Could
you please have a look at it? My main problem is bad direction of
play, which I tend to straighten out with unreasonable fighting :\)
So, please criticize anything that doesn't strike you as natural.

Best wishes,

Hi Jan,

Recently I have been reading a "Selected Openings" by Go Seigen, and
I learned a tesuji to seal a corner from outside.  I have used it
twice in real games on IGS.  The first time I made one move wrong
and the seal wasn't perfect and later seemed to cost me the game.
 The second time seemed to be a great success \(I understood that
move this time\), but the game was adjourned after about 100 moves.
 Luckily I remember the moves, and I would like to ask your comments.
 I made some brief comments too.

BTW, I feel this is a good chance to tell you yet another alias of
mine, and I did it in the game comments. :-\)

It's difficult. Since the upper white group can live, the black center

End of variation.

The black corner has a strong shape although still two cutting points
\(at \[a\] and \[b\]\).

This diagram shows that black shouldn't play this variation under
all circumstances since white gets quite strong at the upper edge
too. Normally black is only willing to give white this strong shape
when the resulting strength along the upper edge is overconcentrated.

;B[dj]M[fc]L[ed][fd][ec][ge]C[
\[Jan & Kishiko:\]
The position in the diagram would be a great succes for black
since the marked white stone is too low \(inefficient\) in this position.
That stone should be at \[a\] or \[b\].

Later black can make white even more overconcentrated by playing the
sequence \[a\], \[c\], \[d\]. This sequence will enlarge the black
influence on the left edge and flatten whites position.]

R10 is big. I think G3 is better than C7, but I like F3 even better. F3 looks

Black is alive on both sides, and it looks very difficult to kill the white

good point, and invading White's moyo on the top is another possibility.

Should play more for the sides and corners.  Leaving the option open for the

General Comments for White.

Should ignore the little stuff.  If you are alive then take territory by 
threatening weak stones.  Don't attack for the sake of attacking something.  
Make sure it stakes out territory.]

;W[nq]C[I think this is an unusual 
placement for white.  This would be a standard pattern for a stone on the 4-4 
point being approached by a small knight extention.

But as it is I think you don't put any pressure on black.

I prefer "a" or a pincer attack.]L[op]
;B[oo]C[See Black wants to run 
into the middle anyways, a pincer would have doing that while attacking.]
;W[rp]C[Very small move at this point of the game.  If you had pincered black 
then he could count on one eye on the edge an find another in the center.  
Running into the corner would be small for black if you got the side.  And 
you can easily live on the bottom with a few extra moves.]
;B[qp];W[qq]
;B[pj]C[A Pincer would have stopped this at the expense of a little territory in 
the corner.  But You would have influence on bottom and center in exchange.]
;W[qh]C[The question to ask is where would black like to go next?  The best 
answer I can see is D10 becauseit takes an entire side and still leaves room 
for an extension up one of the side.

The best move for white is d10.  White can jump to one side or the other and 
easily get a living shape.

The Second best place for white it either F16 or K16.  F16 will get pincered 
but that's okay.  K16 I think is too slow.

K4 is even slower.]
;B[oe]C[This is a mistake.  I don't know what it is trying 
to do.  If it is trying for territory then it counts on white making big 
mistakes.]
;W[od]C[A good response, but still d10 is bigger.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[pe];W[qe];B[nf]
;W[qj]C[Chamelon said "Should be n17"
I disagree.  The corner is alive and n17 is too slow of an extension.  It 
gains territory yes, but there are bigger points to be had.

Don't be afraid to tenuki.  If the stones will live as they stand,\(or can 
easily become that way if attacked\) then look for a bigger point.]

;W[rl]L[qi]M[rl]C[The marked stone does little to gain territory and the safty of 
this group would better be served by playing "a"

about maybe 5 points \(I can't count very well yet\) and there are much 
bigger points to be taken.]

to go R14.  The stones at S9 and S8 are about to be cut off.

captured and it would be making inroads on Black area.  Even though Black is 
strong here and should be left alone.]W[qf]

;C[Now that Black got 
the side, White needs to think big here and figure out a way to take some 
territory back.  But he has to build influence first.  Terretory follows 
thickness.

Black is probably looking at k10 or something like that.]B[dj]
;W[dq]
;L[fp]C[This is the wrong move for black.

Black should let White take some of the corner.  A move at F4 or "a" would 
give him even more of the center and side.  Black can still crawl into the 
corner.]B[cp]

Black can push through these stones easily leaving one group or the other 
stranded, while he builds a wall.

White should have protected his side by going "a"]
;C[He pushes through.

White strategy now should be to eat as much of the center up as possible

complete the invasion at C13.  Perhaps by going F17.  Surely White can live

Aiming at a big corner or lot's of influence in the
center.]

;W[cq]C[Only choice for White I think.]
;B[dq]C[Wise move.  But see how little profit Black is getting for
his 3 stone wall?  And he's not 
alive yet.  F4 can still escape to the center.]

think I would have gone at (A) trying to take the corner
back.]
;W[bo]
;B[do]C[This seems very over concentrated!]
;W[cm]
;B[gn]L[em][cr]C[This is a very slow move and does nothing in the way of
threating white or building 
profit.  Black looks intimidated at this point.  (A) is working towards a
larger moyo and destroys the 
center better.  Even (B) is better because it gains profit in the corner in
sente.]
;W[df]L[ce]M[cj]C[White is really aiming at the side not the 
corner.  (A)
seems to protect the corner and 
attack the white stone.  The marked black stone should come in handy by
depriving white of eye space, 
but we should assume that white will survive anyways.  (A) seems the most
profitible way to attack white 
though.]
;B[fc]L[fd]M[df][cj]C[(A) is better here.  It prepares to 
attack the marked white
stone and make it ineffecient, by 
utilizing the marked black stone.  As it is it doesn't attack anything, nor
does it secure territory yet.  White 
will be able to live on the side and the marked black stone make be swallowed
as well.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[ce]
;B[ej]L[bc]C[(A) seems the best point here.  
It secures the corner and
attacks the white stones by 
depriving them of eye space.  Black is running away prematurely.]
;W[bc]C[Now 
white is secure.]
;B[cb]
;W[em]C[White threatens the D4 group preparing to 
attack the E10
stones]
;B[fm]L[en]C[I think I would have choosen (A).  Trying to contain 
white
is not going to work.  And the 
E10 stones can still run to the center, and the D4 stones will live.]
;W[fo]
;B[en]M[fm]L[fn]C[Now it seems that the marked stone should be at 
(A).]
;W[fn];B[dm];W[el]
;B[gm]L[dl]C[This was not good.  The ladder 
didn't work and this move was
redundant, essentially 
giving white a free move. (A) would have been better.  the E10 stones would
have been connected to the 
D4 stones and one of the white groups would have died.]

can connect at D15.]

;B[di]L[bb][bl]C[I 
don't know what this stone is aiming at.  It threatens
nothing and gains no profit, nor 
does is protect anything.  (A) is a better point for attacking and gaining
profit.  (B) is another choice that 
is better.]

point to attack from.  At
least (B).]
;W[jc]C[Now White has an ideal 3 space extension from a 2 stone
wall.  Black is 
overconcetrated on the top, and the top right corner is invadable.]

;B[gf]L[pc][qc]C[This attacks nothing, and secures no 
territory.  If Black
can think of nothing else to do

;B[qc];W[qh]
;B[rg]C[There is not much to say about the game from now on.  The
root cause of Black's lose is 
trying to play White's game.  Black played complex moves and neglected to
look for simple moves that 
did the following: (1) Attack (2) Gain Profit. (3) secure threatened stones.
 Additionally Black's stones did 
not work together.  An observation I have made is: The one with the least
number of connected live 
groups wins.  Try to keep your stones working together.  They are more
efficient that way.  In this game 
White end up with 3 live groups, and Black will have 4 live groups.  In terms
of gaining territory, white is 
more efficient.]

;W[cl]L[nq][fq][dq][iq]N[Beginning of the end]M[dp]C[At this 
stage I would have played at "a". The move at C8 is not only a bit aggressive 
against a strong position but also too small for the beginning. A move at "a" 
would work nicely with the marked stone. Furthermore, when Black plays at 
"b", White feels compelled to respond at "c", thus allowing Black to play the 
excellent move at "d".  The more I analyzed your game the more I came to feel 
that not playing at "a" was the beginning of your undoing.]

marked stone.]

needed to play on Black's side of the board sooner.]
;W[qf]L[qn][qk]N[Wrong direction?]C[In this position I would have played at "a", mostly 
because a Black response around "b" would still leave the lone Black stone at 
the top still vulnerable for a subsequent White attack.]
;B[qh]M[pp]C[This 
is a good move by Black. By playing the tight pincer,  he's inviting you to 
play in the corner, and his pincer stone is working well with his marked 
stone in the lower corner. With this move, Black is threatening to build up 
the lower side of the board. Therefore, you might want to consider Var 2. ]

;B[le]C[At 
this point Black has enormous influence with  potential to grow, whereas 
White has secure territory but limited potential to grow. Since White has 
sente, his next move is important.]
;W[qn]C[I can understand your desire to 
stirke deeply in Black's sphere of influence, however, in this situation, 
White will simply become a target, and Black, while attacking,  will acquire 
secure territory; this is where his influence will pay off. I have to admit 
that in this situation, it's hard to think of a good move for White, so 
overwhelming is Black's position.]

of good ideas in this game. He deserved to win, especially for his strong
middle game play in the lower right. The game slipped away through a little
thoughtless greed.

Black can improve his game by a stone by following up his own moves when
white ignores him. When white tenukis, follow your own move up unless white
has played an absolute sente
move.]

early by making two mistakes in the direction of play.

Black kept white in the game by misplaying the lower left corner and failing
to continue attacking white's invasion of the lower right.

White did not make effective use of his attacking potential on the one weak
black group in the center right.

Ordinarily, this would mean that white would lose...

But Black self-destructed in handling the invalid white invasion on the top
right.

White has good hand-to-hand fighting skill. He needs to supplement this with
greater global
vision.]

You need to build using the stones you have on the board already. Creating

;SZ[19]BS[0]WS[0]GM[1]FF[3]PW[mi3ke]WR[3k]PB[unknown]C[White's position became tenuous quite early due
to the play in the lower right corner. White gave up too much to for his
center profit.

The main lesson of this game involves paying attention to the twin issues of
connection and liberties. These issues are key ingedients in life and death
and in evaluating thickness, so they are actually more fundamental \(bearing
attention on a move by move basis.\)

In general, white is too willing to sacrifice stones. A group is not a
candidate for sacrifice unless it has exhausted its strategic purpose. 

A clump of stones separating two of the opponent's  living groups is a good
candidate for sacrifice because there is no strategic purpose in separating
two live groups.]

opportunities to pressure this group.

;W[pr];B[or];W[qs]
;B[dj]C[Well B got sente and the 
big point. But W now
has sente, W needs to examine the B wall at the bottom.
It's been severly weakened. A W invasion at the bottom 
is feasible. W probably needs to avoid B having time
to strengthen around F5. I'm seeing invasion points
near G3, K4 and D3. W can always play B4 but B can
concede a small life in the corner.]

;B[df]C[B C7 seemed a bit restrained to me. W 
has some hope; he took
2 good points and now B plays a curious move. B appears to

and maybe get sente?]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ce]
;B[gd]C[I think that at this point you 
need a plan. Are you going to let
black live on a small scale - and presumably take sente? Or
do you need to attack him severely - higher risk, bits might
drop off. Can you protect your weakness around M17 while you
are doing so. Will reducing B centre/bottom do or will an 
invasion be needed?

The only way to decide (rather than intuit) is
to count. I almost never do this ;-(

Lets map out a plausible denoument if you let him live ...
B has about 15 on the right. 30 left + corner, should be
no more than 10 at the top if he lives. How big can the
bottom get then? Well W might get 20 top left, 12 bottom
right, the top's hard to count but assuming he's playing to
let B live so he gets 30. That means that if B gets 15 or
so at the bottom he probably wins, so even third line
terretory there will be enough.

My conclusion: You MUST get sente or kill B. reduction and
standard jose won't do.]
;W[ed]
;B[ff]C[So far so good; You've solidified a 
corner. B has
effectively "reduced an area that wasn't really
yours to begin with. I don't see a really strong attack
on the B group, but that's not surprising, it was a
shallow reduction from a strong position. 

Rememberig the plan, W still has sente. Could he now
invade the lower side? I think so. But there's a weakness
around M17. So perhaps another move or so here is
in order.

In the actual game W get's into one of those frustrating
sequences where plausible sente moves are ignored for
just long enough to reduce their effect.]

;W[eh];B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[fb];W[eb];B[fi];W[fh]
;B[hf]C[Well you still have sente. Is B alive? I can't tell.
After F16 almost certainly, but F16 for W will allow
B to run. As he has lots of space to run in, I'd say
that the best you can hope for is a semi-sente move
at K14. So now is the last chance for the invasion.
so far B hasn't greatly strengthened the mojy. F11
does help him, but not too much.]

I think any of K4, J4 or J3 work. By work I mean lead to enough

blocks at 'a' to build a wall facing down the left side, white will get
sente to play at 'b', which reduces the wall's influence a great deal.
But if black blocks at 'c' instead, the marked stone will become too
close to the wall to be efficient. Therefore, to play this narrow pincer, 
black would like to have a stone around 'b' himself.

A pincer at 'd' or 'e' would let black block at 'c'
without becoming overconcentrated. Such a pincer would also work much better 
together with the handicap stone in upper right.

;B[dh]BL[1355]C[This is IMHO too aggressive. The purpose of a cut, is to make the enemy
weaker by splitting him up. Therefore the player who makes the cut
must have reasonable attacking possibilities against at least one,
preferably both of his opponents cut-off groups. It's also helpful
if the cutting group is backed up by some thickness in the neighborhood.

In this case, white's wall above is too tall and strong to be a good target, 
and white's cut-off stone can take care of itself, starting
with a sente move against black's edge followed up by an atari, as in
the game. Black's cutting stone will only be a burden to him if he
decides to try to keep it alive.

I don't know what's best for black on the left edge; whatever he tries,
white can seal him in. See var. B. Maybe he should tenuki. My alternatives: 
1) a kakari (F6 [a\]) against white's lower left, or 2) a moyo-building move

;W[qp];B[dd]
;W[qf]C[Here 
black have several options how to mess with white. One thing 
that black DON'T want is to let white live on the right side without a fight. 
Instead, lets see what black can do with building walls.]
(
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]
;W[qj]C[This it should be obvious now that the attach-and-extend 
joseki is 
not to prefere here since white gets a stabile group and no worries. Now to 
make the best out of the situation, black should consider k16, or k15 as an 
extension.]
;B[md]C[This is to narrow. remember that if you don't understand 
how the 
joseki works on the table, using it may prove to be more of a burden than a 
asset.]
;W[fd]C[Now white will attack the left in order to reduce the right. 
Pincer 
is the only thing here.]
;B[hd]C[good. Now white must either escape or get a 
base. I allways prefer 
escaping. It's a tougher path but more fun. ;)]
;W[dc]C[White sneaking under 
to try to get a base.]
;B[cc];W[ec]
;B[ce]C[I'd prefere d15.  Simpler, neater 
and more attacking.]
;W[cb]
;B[bb]C[Overplay. Just waiting to be cut. play 
simpler, like b17 and you will 
win many nights of good sleep. =)]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[ac];B[ad];W[cd]
;B[bf]C[Now 
white has secured a good base on the upper side, gotten a few 
rather nice ko threats and black have about nuthing.]
;W[cc]
;B[op]C[This point 
is very big. It should have been played earlier in the 
game. Perhaps if n16 would have been played at k16 instead, the h16 would not 
be needed and you could have played at p4 instead. Though you got this point 
anyway =) Now lets see how you use it.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq]
;B[oo]L[mp]C[The standard continuation of the joseki is a, which makes white 
sliding under gote. now it's sente for white.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[qn]
;B[om]C[This 
is not really sente. White could play elsewhere.]
;W[pl]
;B[mr]C[this is 
neither sente. White should ignore this. Now we basically 
have the same situation as in the upper side with a big black wall on the 
right side and a lonely stone on the left. guess where white will attack =)]
;W[fq]
;B[hq]C[Pincer is still good. Now it's the low one spaced pincer which 
is a 
good one. As in the upper right corner, what black wants is for white to jump 
into the corner.]
;W[cq]C[White plays along nicely. Now the obvious move is 
c4, NOT d3. D3 is 
VERY bad. Ok. one could argue that it plays well with the left group but lets 
compare the difference with the two plays.]
(
;B[dq];W[cp]
;B[cr]C[Excuse me, 
but this is awfull. =) You let white destroy your left 
side completely and you will get one stone for your worries =)]
;W[br]
;B[er]C[NONONONONO! What is so horrible with white taking one lousy stone at 
c2? compared with him running upwards the left side? One stone is 2 points. 
Running up the left side is 20-30 points per move! (Perhaps not exact 
calculations, but at least to demonstrate the graveness of the move)]
;W[cs]C[This is a feeble move from white. it's jose moves! Should not be 
played until the endgame. =)]
;B[dr];W[co];B[do];W[cn]
;B[ci]C[Again a bit to 
narrow extension to work. The question though is if 
any extension would work well here. d6 is a huge move now for white since it 
forces black to try to save his group. White have nicely lost the preassure 
on his groups and can concentrate on pressing blacks group.]
;W[dn];B[fo]
;W[ho]C[interesting move. Not sure it will work though.]
;B[gp]C[This is a bad 
respons. You should have cutten white into two with f6. 
If white runs with h7 black runs along. White will be forced to run to the 
left side or live in the middle.]

run from i suspect.]

;B[ir]C[This is to weak! You should punish 
white for trying to live inside 
two black walls.]
;W[jq]
;B[jr]C[Don't answer such a move! k2 is no threat 
anyway since you can block 
at h2]
;W[hp]
;B[fn]C[Now white have gotten a good base for extending into the  
middle.]
;W[jd]C[Great pincer. It can actually run into the middle if black 
sneaks 
under it. ]
;B[gf]C[black running? It's something like running from your 
fortress when 
you outarm the enemy. You should use your thickness to attack. l17, k14 or 
something. (k14 actually aims at the lower-middle white group)]

;C[Summary: 
I've neglected to comment on the endgame since the endgame 
was so controlled by how the players played in the opening. I've just tried 
to point out larger mistakes in the endgame. Both players should think of 
what they want to do with their stones. You don't throw stones on the board 
randomly, you must have a plan when you place the stone, otherwise you could 
just aswell pass. I would like to apologize if i sounded to harsh but it 
allways works for me when someone yells a little. (And boy have i heard a lot 
of yelling =).]

Here is your game - unfortunately I cannot get the Commentary to work 
with my version of MGT for Windows (version0.4) so I am going to have
to put my comments in here.

The main areas of development I see for you are to combine attacking play 
with developing territory and to notice vulnerable connections and build
more solid walls.

q8 - I'd play either at R11 or Q7 so as to ensure territory

D18 - Bad move - to share the corner connect at D17 - E18 becomes 
vulnerable

C15 - Play at D15 to be solid

E19 - To protect against this kind of invasion play moves to make solid
walls

R4 - Much better move here than D18

K10 - Good move attacking but also territorial

P4 - Watch for these vulnerable edge positions like S6 - players will often
watch for them

P7 - You had the same problem in this corner - as in other one - most
diagonal connections are vulnerable - you do get to make a wall in the
end but do it earlier - the wall you make then radiates influence up
the board

H3 - needs a response - G4 or J4 - you would then start to build a wall
here - also G4 then becomes less of a threat

G6 - This is too attacking - allows H6 - play H6 yourself - 3 stone walls 
are much stronger - then hane

G10 - Notice how white builds a wall and then extends from it

F8 - excellant move - you both attack and build territory

J13 - again good move

L12 - better to strengthen K10 so white cant get around it - keep
white heavy here

C8 - the main tactical tasks here are to attack white so he doesnt
get eyes - to stop the centre group connecting - and to consolidate
territory in top right - E10 would be good here - it stops the eye 
and you just keep white heavy

E19 - A better option is O19 which will kill the white group

Q19 - White saves his group !!

P13 - forgetting these vulnerable stones is the kind of mistake a lot of us 
make !! and vow to never
make again !

C4 - a better place to invade - but still an overplay - is C3 - the 3/3
point is nerely alwys the most attacking place to invade.


In general terms I'd recommend that you focussed on good shape - Life
and Death by Ishi Press is quite good on this as is the second book
of Go.

absolute 
 no-no. Basically E17, F17 become very weak due to shortage of liberties. The

like this one. It has only 
 one meaning: defence. In terms of points, it is an order of magnitude 
smaller

 zero point value, he would be commiting himself to actually capturing one of 
 the black groups \(or he would have wasted an entire move\). Conversely, 
when 
 black wastes a move here the white stones become light \(i.e. expendable\). 
So 
 if white were to tenuki here, and black later capture the white stones, B14 
 would be completely wasted. 
 Because of the weakness at a\), black should try to fight on, turning at b\) 
\(see 
 Var. 1\). 
 You should take some time to consider the strategic principle here. There is 
a 
 very real sense in which, when black plays B14 he has already 'lost' the 
fight. 
 It is the same principle that states that you should normally jump out into 
 the centre before forming two eyes along the edge.]B[bf]
(

 gote capturing them. So he should play a\) \(black b\) etc. wouldn't make 
sense
 for black\). 
 This is a pushing battle. A position very similar to the one here is covered 
 in 'Lessons in the fundamentals of go' by Kageyama \(in the chapter 'The 
 stones go walking' I think\).

closing comments: white needs to be more patient.  take care of your groups.  
when your opponent makes a mistake play *carefully* (not recklessly over 
aggressive) and try to accumulate small advantages.  

keep studying and Good luck!  The most important to remember when playing Go 
is to have *fun*.  When winning is not so important you will find it easier 
be patient and as a result you will do better.

To conclude i think that w knows how to play safely, and how to defend. But 
he has to learn how to use strength to attack (i do not know either :-). The 
better sign is b play at p17, where w was the strongest, that now extends up

the idea would be to use blacks submissiveness with F17 and push black one 
step further
compared to the common joseki with White E16 instead of F16. But this 
strategy is perhaps
more interesting when white has a position in the lower left. 

With G17 i guess you are trying to get control of the upper side, and I

Look at the stones in your area.  Everybody is settled, so it's just a matter 
of territory.  You've got only three points more even though you played the 
first 3 stones in the area.  

Now you've got those 3 stones up top, but they aren't making territory.  they 
are in an attacking position.  Given that there is nothing there for them to 
attack, you'd prefer them to be in a different configuration  \(r17,o17 
instead of r15,o16\)  this d
rawback is worth much more than the 3 points.

Ask yourself, which do you prefer, your 4 stones on the top side?  or white's 
2 4-4 stones plus the move?

white in this game.]TW[sh][si][ri][lr][mr][nr][os][ns][ms][ls]

need one more move to take.  Better to 
connect your stones with m16.  If white's other group were weaker you could 
attack strongly with o14 or n15, but this won't have enough effect on white 
here.

playing n17 causes what Otake calls a family feud.  What you do to help the 
three stones in the corner is countered by how much weaker you are making 
k16.]

Even assuming white get's *nothing* from his groups in the bottom left, he is 
ahead by 18.  

Did you realize this during the game?  Developing a feel for where you stand 
is important.

Even at our level this is a hopelessly lost game.   

The key to this game was the fighting in the center top.  You played moves to 
weaken k16, and then trying to save k16 weakened everything else.

The rest was just tactics.

Avoid letting your stones get surrounded... when they do, play on weaknesses 
to help them.  the *last* thing you want to do is let your opponent build a 
loose net around your stones, and then force him to fix all his weaknesses.  

But this is exactly what you did to/with k16.

;W[pq]C[A small 
nit, but I don't really like Q3.  It invites Q5, which is a perfect
move for black.]
;B[qo]
;W[qp]C[With R3, you are asking for small territory in 
the corner in exchange for
outside influence for black.  Since that outside influence works well with
black's Q16, this is not good for white.  I would prefer a pincer, like Q8 
instead, although that leads to lots of fighting.  A simpler course might be
P4 or O4, which works better with the D4 stone.]
;B[op]
;W[mq]C[N3 is too far 
out.  I'm not sure even O3 is possible, although it would be really 
awful to push at P3 and give black so much influence.  I might try to thwart 
black's
aim with Q4, followed by a cut.  This is really ugly, but better than being 
hemmed
into the corner with no recourse.  See the variation.]
(
;B[pp];W[qq];B[pm]
;W[cf]C[Dangerous to leave the lower right as it is.  If I were black, I 
would 
ignore C14 and go P3 right now.  A cutting point like this is a real 
liability.
White just gets tiny life in the corner, and N3 becomes a big target.]
;B[ce]
;W[dj]C[C15 was really not a good move for black, but white lets him get away 
with it.
C14 is under severe attack; you can't cut him loose.  D14 is almost mandatory 
\(although E14 might be playable\).  D10 offers black the long sente 
sequence, which
he plays with delight.  Sure, white gets some territory on the left, but 
black's
wall is invaluable.

Variation 1 shows the standard joseki, which is great for white.]

often the right move, but in this case

;W[fc]C[Two comments:

First, I would keep badgering black's lower left group for a while.
If nothing else, B4 is probably sente.  Also black C9 looks kind of scary.

Second, if you want to enter the upper side, F17 seems a little too close to
black's thick wall.  If black were going to play on the upper side, he would
probably go for K16.  Consequently, that would be a good point for white, 
too.]
;B[fd]
;W[jc]C[Oops!  Don't abandon F17 so soon.  G16 would be good here. 
 
K17 is a little too far to connect comfortably.  Black G17
would leave the white stones either cut apart, or smooshed
completely against the edge.]
;B[jd]C[This is a poor move by black.  A general 
rule is that contact plays are 
for desperate defense.  White shouldn't let himself get plastered to the
edge here.  I'd follow this up with J16.]
;W[hc];B[hd]
;W[jp]C[Although this is 
a fair point, it's too early to leave the upper side.
Black L17 would seal you in with small life and give black a huge moyo in
the upper left.  You should probably play something like variation 1...]
(

too low and

likely to eliminate.]L[id][cp][qn][mc]

up there, white can aim at making black overconcentrated on the top in

stone.

is, it's probably better to make a base. ]L[fc][pc]

;L[co]C[jlee: What is 
the joseki here?
reid: Good question!  I just looked in Ishida's "Basic Dictionary of Joseki 
Vol 2" \(page 108\) where it says that b3 is a trick play. The correct 
response seems to be to cut at C5]W[bq]
(
;B[dr]
;L[cr]C[reid: i think w 
should atari at c2 first...]W[bo]
;C[reid: b c6 seems to me to be just a bit 
aji-keshi. the d7 stone is pretty much a sacrifice in this joseki anyway, so 
trying to make shape here is a little questionable.  on the other hand, c6 
could make a great ko threat sometime later...]B[cn]
;W[co]
;C[reid: this push 
is usually used when w has answered d4 with c6. in that joseki, white's shape 
doesn't allow him to hane at f7, so he has to submit with e7 and b is 
satisfied. 

in this joseki however, w can hane at f7 which makes the cut at f4 a problem. 

perhaps b should h5 here, although it's a shame to help white out that 
way...]B[fn]
;W[fm];B[fq]
;C[reid: this looks like aji-keshi for w. the two 
stones are not much better off than the single stone was, but after the 
connection, b is very strong here.]W[gp]
;B[fp];W[em]
;C[reid: this feels a 
little too close to white's thickness to me.]B[dj]
;C[reid: this is good - w 
attacks b on a large scale and punishes d10 by pushing back towards his 
strong wall.]W[dh]
;B[fj];W[fh];B[hn]
;C[reid: i think w would be better off 
playing more patiently with something like l3 or m3. 
he's already gained from the d10/12 and f10/f12 exchanges.]W[gj]
;B[gk];W[gi];B[hk];W[hm];B[fl];W[gm]
;C[reid: making a bamboo joint with h4 would be a bit 
safer.  this way, w can use the threat of pushing and cutting later.]B[in]
;W[kp];B[im]
;C[reid: o4 seems a bit funny.  the white group here is undercut 
on both sides, so there is almost no territory there.  perhaps w should 
consider q5 instead.]W[np]
;C[reid: the vital point for life for both sides!  
nice spot :-\)]B[br]
;W[po]
;C[jlee: Terrible shape, isn't it?
reid: actually, the shape isn't so bad, but perhaps d8 is a little better. 

i would probably expect to be able to kill white about now :-\)]B[cl]
;W[el]
;C[reid: i think i would prefer to play e10 instead of e9.  seems a bit 
stronger on the outside, ond not too much difference on the inside.]B[ek]
;W[ar];B[bs];W[ck]
;C[reid: this move is bad shape though :-\( it makes an 
empty triangle at e10. how about the hane at b9 instead?]B[dk]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[cj]
;C[reid: so white lives, but b is stronger here, and he has 
sente.]W[bn]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]
;C[jlee: It was hard for me to decide 
between upper side and right side. I thought the game was favorable to w at 
this point.

reid: i think it's still pretty even, maybe even in black's favor now. 

i would prefer taking something round q10 over k17.  q10 makes w's thickness 
at q6 a bit strange.

on the other hand, if w takes k17 after b takes q10, w's box is undercut on 
the left, and this whole moyo is really pretty thin for him.]B[jc]
;W[qf];B[nd]
;C[reid: this is ideal for w.]W[pj]
;C[reid: might be good for b to peep at 
e13 before playing g17]B[gc]
;W[de];B[rd]
;C[reid: the usual thing for w here 
is to play p2 or o2.  q4 seems to help b more than w.]W[pp]
;C[reid: if b just 
plays r2 instead, he either gets sente, or a good long jump into white's 
territory.]B[oq]
;W[nq];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[nr];B[qr];W[of]
;C[jlee: I thought 
this was a bit small, but the terrible shape of mine, and weakness around j8 
made me play this...

reid: that's good reasoning, i'd say.  white could use that weakness to build 
up his right side moyo.  by cleaning up the issue now \(while eating into 
white's upper side\) b avoids that problem.]B[bh]
;C[reid:  this seems to be 
the wrong direction for w. it feels to me like white is losing his cool 
perhaps.]W[md]
;C[reid: good response!]B[ne]
;W[re];B[qe];W[pe];B[qd];W[rf];B[me];W[sd];B[sc];W[se]

slow territorial move like r17.

At this point I resigned the game since w owned the entire center of the 
board!  Maybe I
should have tried to kill the w group q13 to save my center group but it 
seems my stones don't
have enough liberties to fight.

Rob- I think this is true. Not a bad time to resign.

Some final comments: I think the main lesson of this game is, realize where 
you are strong, and play to it. That doesn't mean to overconcentrate your 
stones, but to realize where your potential in that game lies, and take 
advantage of it. I think you played pretty well in this game, but just made a 
few slow moves, which got you into trouble against a stronger fighter.]

;W[de]C[Rob - While there is nothing 
wrong with 6, I feel that it if you do not take the big point at a or b, then
you should make a special effort to come out of the upper left joseki with 
sente, and play it then.  It seems to my 15k brain that those points opposite 
the 3-4 5-3 corner enclosures are VITAL to avoiding a major moyo development 
by your opponent. (Note: these comments are made before I look at the rest of

 rich 23k*: good game chris, thanks

And I resigned the game here.  My invasions failed and there is no way my 
center moyo could compete with his top (seems his bottom and my left similar 
size)

Rob- This was a good place to resign. A few notes: Try to concentrate a bit 
more on the actual status of your groups. Don't make moves to support groups 
that aren't really weak.  This type of thinking will keep you from getting 
behind in the first 50 to 75 moves..Gotta make sure to get your share of the 
big points. 

Stop at  several points to count. Maybe move 50 and move 100. Perhaps more 
frequently if you don't feel you have a handle on what the status of the game 
is. I realize that it isn't easy to guess what your thickness or the enemy's 
thickness is worth, but give it a shot. The important thing is to know when 
you have to invade (because you are behind), and when to grab some points or 
solidify. 

I should clarify: When behind, you can (obviously) catch up by invading or by 
taking big points..Building thickness (like m4) isn't so good at that point, 
because it is too long term, and requires sente (For a moyo builder like p10 
or so..), which your opponent may not grant you. :)

This was a better game to comment, as your opponent, chris, played well.. For 
the most part, you played fine, just realize that a few slow moves at the 
beginning can kill you. That's why you see those strong players often taking 
a long time in the fuseki.. They know that fighting is great, but if your 
opponent is the same strength, you can't always win fighting from a 
disadvantage.. Sorry about the length of these comments, happy going! :)]

;B[bg]C[Kang said this 
move was slow. I intended it to undercut d12 group and give my group
a base, but it allows w to take a big point in the center.

Rob- b13 is slow. However, slow is not necessarily bad in hi h-cap games.]
;W[jh]C[
 Kang 13k*: b13 slow]

 rich 23k*: deprive d12 + defend was my idea
 Kang 13k*: i know]
;B[kg]L[lh]C[
 Kang 13k*: but it would be hard for d12 to get a base there anyway

Not a good move I think.  I was worried that w could cut me, and this move 
was intended
as a sente peep to strengthen my connection.  But (1) w didn't treat it as 
sente, and
(2) w could still cut me at 'a' I think.  Seems much more important to save 
k10 stone, which w prompty pounces on.

Rob- Right. and the reason w pounces is that the l11 string is weak as hell.]
;W[jk]
;B[jg]C[Since I had peeped and he didn't respond, I felt obligated to 
cut him.  Giving w a ponnuki in the exact center of the board was a disaster! 
 With his ponnuki his center group was strong, and his top left group was 
also strong enough, so the cut was small. 

Rob- Basically, cutting one living group into two.

This was what I call a "reflex move" - I made the move on the basis of local 
shape without really thinking about it.]
;W[ij]C[
 Kang 13k*: u deprive w a base on the side but gave it a ponuki in the center]
;B[if];W[ie]
;B[ig]C[Well at least I was able to remove the threat of the cut 
at n12 by connecting to the left.]
;W[id];B[jc];W[je];B[kd];W[qc]
;B[qd]C[Seems 
'a' would be better, since the w string at o17 would have a tough time making 
room for eyes.  I wanted to block w off from my territory, but the net result 
is to give those w stones at o17 a nice base.

Rob- Actually, I think that r16 is fine. ]L[ob]
;W[ob]
;B[hc]C[Rob- My 
feeling here is..If you are going to play strong, and take sente here, why 
not use the r16 move and do a! That gets you a TON of points :)

At this point, the marked group is not in any danger at all. It's connected! 
The only point of h17 is to make an eye on the edge, which you really don't 
need. Be greedy, take the points! :) ]M[jc][jd][kd][ke][le][lg][kg][li][lj][jg][ig][if]L[pm]

 Kang 13k*: ....]
;B[he]C[As Kang points out later, 'a' is much tougher here.  
Again I thought this was sente but w chose to give up his stones at j15.  
This is a big difference from playing low kyu players.  Against a low kyu my 
move would definately be sente :(

Rob- Right, but I must admit, even though a is nasty to w, I'd really want to 
do b now :) Maybe even c, or even d!
I know, it isn't sente, but taking big moves in h-9 is really important, I 
think. If you use sente to do stuff like that (if groups aren't in danger), 
then you can't lose against someone close enough to you in strength (like 
Kang is). ]L[mb][pm][qm][dm]

;B[el]L[fm]C[I 
realized these stones were starting to be swallowed by white, so I intended 
this
as a running move, but it was obviously insufficient.  A move at 'a' would 
take a big point and offer to give up these 2 stones in exchange for a big 
bottom.

Rob - Yeah, I agree. 

Though I can't comment about the big bottom. :)]

;B[cf]BL[841]C[Rob - This is a good move. I think a 
might be better. Consider this: So far in this game, it stands roughly thus..

black: bottom-40pts  upper right 35.  a total of 75 solid pts with top 
potential

white:  lower left- 12-15 plus a little thickness right side - 24 - a total 
of maybe 40 plus right side potential. 

You are up 35 pts, and are probably even in potential. If I were you, I'd do 
a or maybe b. I might even get as wimpy as to do c. I don't think you need to 
fight in w's area right now. 

Even after c, look at the marked area's potential!

I'd probably do a here. ]L[fd][fc][jd]M[ka][kb][kc][kd][kd][ke][le][ld][lc][lb][la][ma][mb][mc][md][me][ne][nd][nc][nb][na]

w stones are short of liberties. 

I realize I'm urging a more aggressive course here, where before I was 
cautioning you against fighting when ahead. The difference is that here you 
have local strength, and w doesn't, so you should fight. ]M[ni][oi]L[mi]

;W[mi]WL[832]
;B[kh]BL[362]C[Rob- This 
move should be a. If w shuts you in with b, his territory is still open on 
the top at c, and the marked stones have a good bit of potential left to 
them. Not to mention, you are so far ahead right now, that solid play should 
be your first concern. ]L[nf][mf][lc]M[gg][fg]

;PL[B]C[Rob- Nice 
job. A few remarks: You're a pretty strong fighter for your level, and you 
used it well in this game. I think you could try taking stock of the game in 
midstream, and getting an idea of how risky to play from then on. Against 
this opponent, for the most part you out fought him. But against better 
players, if you manage to take a lead like that it might not be wise to play 
for the fight quite as much.

Also, try to realize when you have sente, and see if it is reasonable to 
break away from the local fight and make a big move somewhere.  The proverb 
"play urgent, then big" is right, but realize when things are urgent and when 
they aren't.  

A final note: Try playing some stronger players without h-caps. Play some 
20k's or so, and see how things go. That is a very good way to improve. 

Also, feel free to send me more games to review, if you felt this one helped.

perhaps d6 (b). ]L[gp][dn]

hasn't played go much get better from the beginning of a game to the end of 
the game. I feel you played better as the game went along, and seemed to have 
more and more of a feel for better moves.  

I would recommend getting some intro go books, and working through a few 
joseki, and life and death problems. My favorite introductory book is 
"Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Kageyama. I found it very helpful. 

Obviously continued play is helpful as well. :) Hope this review has been of 
some help! Feel free to send me more games if it has.]

s16 (c)..

black is ahead in solid territory, but must get into the top. He can't allow 
w to have the whole top, and p15 aims at giving w too much. ]L[li][lc][rd]M

p16 (a). ]L[od]

move here. See the variation. ]L[pc]
;W[qc];B[pe];W[pc];B[rd];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hl];W[im]
;B[ki]C[Rob- b has a problem here. He is ignoring the top, 
which is quickly losing weakness. The middle is maybe 20 pts, while the top 
is 50 pts, potentially! h16 (a), reduces it, b16 (b), reduces a bit, and gets 
b some territory. l11 doesn't get b territory, cause of the marked stones, 
and doesn't hit w where he lives.. If I were w, I'd ignore it, and play k15 
(c). ]L[hd][bd][je]
;W[kj]L
;B[ih]C[Rob- Pretty much the same 
comment here.. ]
;W[hj]C[Rob- This is a VERY small move by w. Again, b16 (a), 
h16(a), and moves like that are the way to respond to this.. ]L[bd][hd]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[gd]C[Rob- Ok! g16 is not what I'd do, but it's 
good. We can see why pushing earlier at g16, or haneing at g15  (a) was so 
huge for w.. There was no reason for w to do anything else.. This could be a 
game winning sequence for b.. The slow moves in the middle by w really hurt 
him here.. If w had g15, he'd be getting territory while showing that the 
marked stones didn't have enough potential..  ]L[ge]M[ih][ki]
;W[gc]
;B[cd]C[Rob- This is very bad for b. h16 (a), seems the only move. It gets b 
some territory, and w almost has to answer. c16 is fraught with danger... 
What will b do if w just d15 (b)? ]L[hd][de]

problem here.. .]L[ll]
;B[df];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[ad]
;W[cc]C[Rob- Even 
here, the biggest move is h16 (a).. b14 (b) is 9 pts in gote for w. b should 
let him have it if he wants it! b takes h16 (a), and if w b14 (b) in gote, 
then b gets h17 (c), to add to w's loss...]L[hd][bf][hc]
;B[af]

game without much trouble.  ]L[hd]

;PL[B]C[Rob- Well, you did a nice job 
reducing w on the left side and the middle to win this game, after playing a 
territory oriented opening. One piece of advice would be to watch where the 
points are. After you limited w's potential in the middle, you almost got in 
trouble by letting him have too much on top.  You did a nice job of taking 
advantage of his slow moves, but I think a stronger player wouldn't have 
given you that chance.. 

A very good opening though, up until g3. I hope this review comes in handy, 
and sorry it took so long. :)

;PL[B]C[Rob- The difference here was that w could have made his LR 
corner live or get ko, 
and b stopped it, after a mistake by w. However, I think b had the game won 
after surrounding the k16 stone on a large scale, and it would not have been 
so 
close if b had run away with his k4 stone earlier..  

You played pretty well though, and should take my comments with a grain of 
salt. I'm not sure if I'm any better than you. Despite that, I hope you find 
my comments helpful. :)

;C[
This is too close to your previous moves near F3. One place to the
right at L3 is better. If you want to play K3, then make the solid
connection at F4. In this position, it would be interesting to connect
at F4 and then extend to K4. After that you can either play O3 and
make a nice position on the bottom, or make a shimari on the top at
E17. ]B[jq]
;W[ed]
;C[
I would pincer closer, perhaps H17. The purpose of the pincer is take
away white's base but a move this far away doesn't do that very well.
After H17, if white attaches at C17, you play the same joseki, but
white doesn't get the nice extension to H17. He will have to run. You
just want to live on the side, and then make a moyo on the top using
your extension/pincer. ]B[jd]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[hc]
;C[
I prefer K17. The left side is not a good place to play for either
side because of the stone at C6. There just isn't much territory to be
gained on the left side for either of you.  The C16 stones can't be
killed, and K17 starts a moyo on the top right.]B[df]
;W[qf]
;B[qd]C[
This seems passive. I would probably jump to O17 and make a moyo on
the top. Had you played K17 last move, you could pincer at R12 and
make profit on the top. Now, though, the top is open at the bottom
because of H17.]
;W[nc]
;B[oc]C[
Much too defensive.  You are strong here so you can easily fight. Play
to separate the two white stones. When White has two weak groups, you
can make territory while attacking them.]
;W[nd]
;C[
Good, but one move too late. The P17, O16 exchange is good for white
because O16 make white stronger, but P17 doesn't do much for you. This
shape \(P17,Q16,P15\) isn' good. Later white may be able to separate
your stones.]B[oe]

;B[pf];W[of];B[pe];W[og];B[pg];W[qg]
;C[
I would continue the attack in the upper right. White has a lot of
weaknesses there. Just push to Q12. What can white do? If he connects
at R12, you can cut at O14 and make two weak groups, an if he protects
the cut, the stones on the right are in trouble when you push through
and cut. In any case C9 is small. O3 is bigger if you just want to
take territory. White must respond. C9 is gote.]B[ck]
;W[hf]
;C[
Your stones around K18 are getting weak. Protecting them is probably
urgent now. Jumping out to L13 is probably forcing because of the cut at
O14. Then you can play R6 if you want to.]B[qn]

This is probably not good. The K18 stones still aren't alive. I would
probably try F17 instead. You can either connect underneat at H18,
making a second eye or cut off some white stones. Either way, you
wont hurt the K18 stones.]B[ge]

Ooops. You need to connect at L1 to make 1 eye. You should be able to
make a second eye at the top, or connect to the outside. Later you may
have to fight the KO at H12. Right now the game is very close.
Although white seems to have a slight advantage, black isn't out of it yet.
Losing the M11 stones is too big to recover from.]B[ik]

Bob- My main point of concern in this game is the opening, where I got

;B[qp];W[cd];B[eq];W[pc]
;C[
I would probably complete the one of the shimaris on the bottom
instead]B[ec]
;C[
You should probably respond in the upper left instead. You could
pincer the E17 stone, perhaps at H17 or J17. The pincer will allow you
to make territory while attacking the E17 group, and it is a good
extention from the Q17 stone.  Black will get a thick position around
E17 and you will get territory on the side. Black's thickness won't
work well because of the pincer stone.]W[oq]
;C[
Good. Attack the P3 stone, while making territory on the right and
bottom. This is an example of what White should have done on the top]B[kq]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pp];B[qo];W[qr];B[pm]
;C[
This is probably not good. It lets black make thickness around the E3
stone which works well with the L3 stone. Black needs to make another
move in this corner anyway, and you are "forcing" him to do it. Make
the shimari in the upper right instead. If black takes C4, you can
take H17, pincering the E17 stone and extending from the shimari.]W[cp]
;B[do];W[co];B[dn]
;W[cm]C[
The farther you go in this direction, the more territory black makes. You make
two or three points for every move, while black makes four or five. Just close
off the corner with D2 or D3 and don't play around here any more.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[bo];W[bm];B[cq];W[bp];B[dm]
;W[dp]C[
Too slow. Don't push against the knights move unless you plan to cut.
The move just makes black stronger, and doesn't get you anything. You
should look at the whole board and make the biggest move when you have
sente.  I would probabl play R15. That give me several good moves next
time, no matter what black does.]
;B[ep]
;C[
How many points is this move worth?  R15 is worth AT LEAST 12 points,
and probably a lot more.]W[dq]
;B[dr]
;C[
Still making black stronger, while getting very little in return.]W[dl]
;B[el];W[ek];B[dk];W[cl];B[fl];W[dj];B[bq];W[ao];B[fk];W[ej]
;C[
Now black has 30-40 points of secure territory on the bottom left,
while white has gained about 10-20. The game looks difficult for white
now.]B[ko]
;W[qe];B[de];W[ce];B[dg]
;C[
Too slow. K17 is VERY big after R15. The C16 stones probably can't be
killed, and D16 just makes black stronger. Again, don't push against
the knights move unless you plan to cut. Look at the whole board and
pick the biggest move.]W[dd]
;B[ed]
;C[
The cut at E15 may be better.  It splits black up into two groups. You
can probably make some territory attacking one of them. Play F15 after
E15 and see what black does.]W[df]
;B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[de];B[jd]
;C[
Good, but a little late. Now, black is strong on the top.]W[ff]
;B[ge]
;W[lc]C[
Taking at D14 is MUCH bigger. Black has about 30-40 points on the bottom
left, and \(after D14\) you have 30-40 on the left side. Black has
maybe 15 points on the top, and you have 12 in the upper left corner.
If black extends on the top, you can extend on the right side and get
about as much. Black is a little ahead, but white still has chances.
This is probably the losing move.]
;B[eg]
;W[gg]C[
Not good. Even if you escape with this stone, you will have let black
solidify his bottom territory while attacking. He gets territory, you
get nothing. You can save this stone later if it seem needed. R10 is
big right now.]

Round 5
1. of May 1994
Black : Dix Sandbech 2d
White : Klaus Sorensen 4k

Result : White wins by 1.5]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[eq]
;W[cj]C[KHS : I 
considered a to have a good kakari follow-up at b, but thought that c was too 
good for
black.

Correct. Your move is the usual move here.]L[ci][cf][ck]
;B[cl]
;W[cf]C[KHS : Perhaps too greedy. My plan was to go for influence if black was to 
invade at a. 

Both your move and the 2 point jump at `b' are common in professional games. 
If the situation is
as open as here, `b' seems more common, and black often answers at `c' or 
`d'. Your move is more 
agressive, but if you know how to handle black `a', there is nothing wrong 
with it \(see the
variations\)]L[ch][cg][gc][jc]
(
;B[gc]L[ch]C[People tend to throw in 
a stone at a to test whites response. The way black played here gives 
white the chance to settle nicely \(see the variations\). To ignore black, as 
you did, seems also
possible, but might run into problems if black invades at a next.]
(
;W[pj]
;B[cd]C[This move just looks too complacant. An invasion is more severe. By 
playing elsewhere again, 
you gain a nice large-scale position, while black hoards all his stones on 
the left.]
;W[jp]C[nice]
;B[ch]
;W[bh]L[bg][bi][dh]C[KHS : I anticipated 
black a or b, and would respond by boxing him in or getting two eyes on the
side. Because of this, black c looks like a good move, forcing white to play 
a and b and not even
be sure of two eyes. 

Right. because black invested so many moves already, you don't mind if he 
gains a bit here.]
;B[el]C[I would prefer to annoy the white group more 
directly, possible with the move c you suggested
before. The move black played is not bad: it takes solid territory and sente, 
aiming to jump 
deep into whites loose formation. It does look a bit slow though.]
;W[dh]C[KHS 
: Now white is thick. I was happy about this result, even though black got a 
big moyo.

Agreed. This move is essential now.]
;B[nc]
;L[kd][ne]W[ld]C[KHS : This 
move is a mistake. I hoped black would invade at san-san, but he wasn't so
cooperative. The resulting sequence is bad for white.

KP: A pincer seems a good idea here, but it should be further away, at `a'. 
If black then 
jumps out to `b', he can't attack as strongly. Another idea for white is the 
keima at `b'.]
;B[ne];W[pf];B[ng];W[ph]
;B[jd]C[KHS : Post game analysis 
indicated that this is too slack. A or b seems better. I
particularily like b as it gives black good shape.

KP: Attacking from strength can't be good, and that is precisely what this 
move is doing.
A black move at `b' instead looks better, but a little cramped. I would 
prefer playing `c'. 
That makes it harder for white to move out. I am not sure about `a'; it looks 
like a 
very severe attack if it works, but it might leave the possibility of a 
counter-attack 
\(proverb: stay away from what you want to attack\)]L[ke][lf][kf]
;W[lf];B[lh]
;W[kg]C[KHS : Bad move as it just induces black a. b seems to be the 
move for white here.

Yes!!! It is much better to lean on the marked stone, it is strong anyway. 
The idea is to 
get as much local shape as possible; a running fight looks unfavourable for 
white.]L[kh][je]M[jd]
;B[kh];W[ig]
;B[ii]L[eh]C[Maybe it is better 
to test whites response by playing `a' now, and then to continue the attack.]
;W[gg]C[KHS : Black has gotten the better of this exchange.. His mistake was 
not putting his center thickness to better use. Had he done so, he should 
have a comfortable win.]AE[fh][di][eg][ef][ff][fg][dg][eh]
;B[eg]C[Misses the point I think, as it doesn't threaten the left side group. `a' 
looks more 
severe.]L[eh]
;W[eh];B[hh]
(
;W[gf]C[This move is the right idea, but you 
should aim for lighter shape here. How about the sequence 
shown in the variation \(node 33\)?]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[jf];W[if];B[jg]
;W[je]C[Nice dodge! This rather spoils the fun for black]
;B[ke];W[ie]
;B[kf]M[kd]L[kd]C[a move at `a' doesn't work.]
;W[ic]C[Another good move. This 
sequence leaves black the proud captor of 3 stones, while white
breaks into the upper side and avoids serious damage. However, whites group 
is still not 
completely connected, and so I think the game is still a bit in blacks 
favour.]
;B[kd]
;W[hc]C[KHS : My opponent suggested after the game that a is 
the proper move, aiming at nasty business in
the corner. The actual move leaves too many weaknesses.

Dix is right. The move at `a' is also almost sente, aiming at the HUGE move 
at `b'.]L[id][ec]
;B[gd]
;W[pc]C[KHS : Correct timing I think. White has 
to secure some points now.

I prefer `a' or somewhere thereabouts. That looks bigger.]L[qp]
;B[qq]C[KHS : Surely black can do better than this. I would prefer kakari at a. 
Black must have counted 
and found himself sufficiently ahead to play safe.

Yes, this move is too complacant and fails to make use of blacks strength. 
Maybe he didn't
expect your sente variation? `a' looks better.]L[qn]
;W[qp];B[pq]
;W[nq]C[Good move!]
;B[nr]C[KHS : I wanted sente...]
;W[mq]
(
;B[mr]C[I dont like this 
second line crawling. The variation shown at node 54 looks preferable. 
It also ends in gote, but it leaves some potential on the right side.]
;L[rp]W[oq]C[KHS : This move seems to be without purpose...

I don't think it is that bad. True, black won't play there in a hurry because 
it would stop `a' 
being sente, but I think that is a small point. You don't destroy much aji I 
can see ...]
;B[or]
;W[mk]C[KHS : White feels he is in the game again..

Agreed.]
;L[fi][fg][ll]B[kk]C[Very bad move! Black should aim to use his 
strength efficiently, not play in front of it.
Now seems to be the right time to play at `a' to split the white groups. The 
connection at 
`b' doesn't work too well, see the variation. In the process of chasing, 
black should be 
able to increase his bottom left corner and to get stones in place for a deep 
invasion 
into whites moyo, giving him a good game. If black insists on
invading immediately, `c' surely works better.]
(
;W[ll];B[kl]
;W[fg]C[KHS : 
Honte. Should probably have been played before. Now the white groups are 
connected. Having
black connect here would be extremely uncomfortable, especially now that 
black is building strength
in the center.

Yes. This move gets whites group out of trouble and puts him ahead. Blacks 
previous move doesn't 
threaten much on the right.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp]
;B[km]L[jq][hq]C[KHS : I can't help but think that continueing at a 
would be good enough for black.

The move black played looks pretty much like sente and can't be bad. But you 
are right,
`a' or `b' \(I prefer `b'\) should come soon.]
;W[lm];B[ob]
;L[pb]W[bp]C[Interesting idea, but it looks tough trying to invade there. Answering 
blacks move at `a' 
is very big and shouldn't be put off for too long.]
;B[cq]
;M[bp]W[co]C[Not 
convincing. I believe that black has better answers to this move than the one 
he played.
I suggest going back to `a' or `b' now. Than you can decide on how to use the 
potential of 
your marked stone later. A move at `c' could prove interesting, and from the 
centre I would 
play at `d' immediately.]L[pb][be][bl][go]
;B[cn]C[Hmmmmmm. I would be 
tempted to play at `a' instead and invite white to 
prove that he isn't simply throwing away points here. ]L[eo]
;W[dn];B[bn]
;W[go]C[KHS : Treating the invasion stones lightly.

Correct procedure. black played many low moves and can't easily dispose of 
all threats 
at once. Still, I think you were lucky to be able to get out in sente like 
that.]
;B[eo]
;W[be]C[Nice idea! Black has his group to worry about if you 
invade very deeply, so he is probably 
right to defend as he does]
;B[bd];W[ad];B[qb];W[pb];B[pa]
;W[qc]L[rc][bc]C[KHS : Should be at a, as black soon will show me in the other corner.

This is true, but even better would be a move at `b'. Whatever he can do to 
you, you can
do to him, and worse.]
;B[rb];W[rc]

Yes it is. Black really should have played thereabouts himself. A black move 
at `a' would 
have threatened the marked stone too.]M[go]L[hq]

him.

proceeded to play well enough to win after

;W[qc]C[reid: normally white jumps out with a \(p14\) or

;B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[mc];B[lc];W[ic];B[fc];W[gc];B[ec];W[gd]
;B[df]C[reid: at this point, 
the black groups at d16 and r16 are
ideal - very strong, difficult to attack.  the g16 and
p16 white groups are weak by comparison.  that makes the
black m16 group a perfect splitting attack.  that should
be the strategic focus \(for both sides\) for the next few
moves.]
;W[rb]C[reid: s18 is gote for white, and should be left for the 
endgame,
or until white really needs eye space \(because he's surrounded\).
better to jump out with something around a \(p14\).]
;B[sb];W[ra]
;B[qo]C[reid: 
black misses a chance to do some serious damage
here.  again, the focus should be the splitting attack
using the m16 group.  how about the hane at a - n18, see if
you can get the right white group down to one eye?  white
answers either by pulling back with b - o17 \(black follows
with c - o18\) or with the hane at c - o18 \(black connects
at d - l18\).  either way, black is much stronger and
white is weaker.]L[mb][nc][nb][kb]
;W[pf]C[reid: white takes advantage of 
black's slip.]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[pg];B[qh];W[ph]
;B[md]C[reid: black is in a 
tough spot here \(due to r5\),
but continuing out on the right \(around a - r11\)
is more urgent.]
;W[nc]C[reid: now white misses a chance. see variation.]
(
;B[jd];W[kb]
;L[hg]C[reid: for white to exchange l18 for m18 is
a great loss. now the gote sequence at s18
and s19 become meaningless.  probably better
for white to come out around a - h13.]B[lb]
;W[kc]
;B[kd]C[reid: white is 
helping black to get nice and thick here.]
;W[hf];B[kg]
;W[mg]C[reid: this move 
doesn't seem to have much
affect on black.  it doesn't threaten to cut
or surround the black stones.  it isn't
necessary for protecting p15 either \(since
the ladder works for white\).  again, pushing
down with a \(r11\) seems like the move for white.]L[qi]
;B[jh]C[reid: 
since n13 wasn't a threat, there is no
need to answer it right away.  better to hane
at a - q11.  the left side white group can live
easily with h18, so there is no fight left in
this area.]L[pi]
;W[hh];B[qi]
;W[jj]L[ij]C[reid: since white has no 
real hope of killing
this black group, it might be better to hold
back a bit and play a - j10 instead.  that way
he doesn't leave a hole behind, and it works
better with the stone at d4.]
;B[li];W[oj]
;B[ii]C[reid: black squeezes through 
the hole.]
;W[hi]C[reid: white can do a better job of encirclement
by holding back with a - g10 instead \(although
it's still not good enough to kill black\).]
;B[ij]C[reid: squeezing through 
like this is a
dagger in white's heart!]
;W[qk]C[reid: this looks like an overplay.  black
can cut off ths stone, and it ends up in
black's sphere of influence.  if white wants
play in this area, he needs to hold back with
a - q9 or b - p8.  but this area doesn't have
much affect on black, so it's probably better
to change strategy and go to c - c12.]L[pk][ol][ch]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[qm]
;L[rn]C[reid: is p11 really necessary now?  how
about a - s6 to de-stablize white?]B[oi]
;L[qj]C[reid: better to not play 
here - white may decide
later that he needs a - r10 for the life of his
r9 group...]W[pi]
;B[qj];W[nj]
;C[reid:  personally, i really like to find 
moves with
more than one purpose.  how about playing at a - n9
here instead?  it threatens to catch the o10 stones
\(black o11 makes a geta\) and it also helps to surround
the r9 stones.  the sahpe that black is left with after
this move is not ideal, since there's a hole at b - n10.]L[mk][mj]B[nl]
;W[ni];B[om];W[rj]
;L[ri]C[reid: hmmm. much safer to block at a - s11
here. then black is alive, and white still has
the burden of trying to get life.]B[pl]
;C[reid:  now it's going to be a 
semeai \(race
to capture\).  if black wants to play this
way, he really needs to read out the whole
fight \(with all possible variations\) beforehand.
otherwise, it's better to play safe \(with s11
instead of q8\).]W[ri]
;B[ql];W[rk];B[rl]
;C[reid:  ouch!!]W[rg]
;C[reid:  
before this loss, black was perhaps
15 points ahead.  now the game is pretty close...]B[ip]
;C[reid:  a basic 
strategic principle is to not
fight where you must fight at a disadvantage
\(see Sun Tzu: "The Art of War" for example\)
white has played a stone right in the middle
of black's sphere of influence.  he should
therefor suffer a strategic loss.  better to
play around a - c12 or b - g3 and try to build
a comparable moyo...]W[kq]

he should try a probe at q2?]W[kp]

a bit more drastic here.  like perhaps the

\(with a - h3\)
after all, black has made a huge investment
in the lower right corner, it's not something

there is no one move by white that can

;B[qq]C[I have a preference here for P6 -- R3 isn't bad, but in a

it is generally a good idea to cut white as often as is practical -- so
the play of P6 immediately seperates white into two groups.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[rn];W[om]
;B[dj]C[In the sequence chosen in the LR corner, you have given 
white outside thickness
in exchange for about 10 points and sente.  I think your best choice for next
move is one that reduces the value of whites thickness, and would prefer a 
play on the bottom side -- I like either K3, K4 -- this is far enough from
white's thickness to not be too close, but close enough that white can't
extend as far as he would like.]
;W[gq]C[> How should this be answered?  Would 
a pincer be better than e3?  the 
> bottom looks huge for white, but what's teh best response?

This is an unusual Kakari -- probably white trying to throw you into
something you haven't seen before, where his strength will give even
more advantage.

The response that most strikes me is the pincer at K4, or possibly
J3.  I don't like K3, it seems to deep, without leaving enough room
for a comfortable two point jump to the right, and without putting
enough pressure on the G3 stone.  Other possibilities that come
to mind -- if you don't want to get into the fight that will,
inevitably, come from the pincer, are the one point jump to D6, 
or the capping play at G5.  \(C7 is probably also reasonable, but
it isn't my style.\)  Even a play at F4 looks reasonable -- though
it may mutate into an attach&extend variant -- which is reasonable
for black.]
;B[eq]C[Part of the problem with this choice, is that it doesn't 
effectively do any of the
things you want done here.  After white K3, his group is settled, and he has 
also
made a perfect extension from his Q3 wall.  But black's corner is still not
settled, nor has black made a connecting move between the handicap stone and
the D10 stone -- both are important.  \(More specifically, white can still 
invade the corner and live, without badly harming the G3-K3 group, but black
hasn't really helped the strength of the D4 stone -- to properly close the
corner still takes at least on more \(gote\) move.  In fact, C3 might be a
far better choice than E3, and also playable -- it does a couple of things,
on it prevents white's G3 stone from living through a dive into the corner,
nor can white invade and live in the corner, the D4 stone now has something
very close to life, and any invasion/reduction on the left side \(such as a
play at C6 by white\) will also have a lot more difficulty -- black can pincer
immediately without worrying about white living through a dive into the 
corner.

I guess I really didn't like E3... actually, G3 is non-threatening enough,
that tenuki is, even, a reasonable choice here... take that K16 point now.]
;W[jq];B[jd]
;W[qf]C[> again, shoule I pincer of do somethign else here. It 
seems just like 
> the bottom, gaining big areas on sides. 

A pincer here is reasonable -- but remember the right side, unlike the
lower, is still open at the bottom -- you have some very good reducing
moves fromt he S7 stone -- T9 \(monkey jump\) can be very expensive, as
with S8 -- depending on the state of stones in the P9 area.  Also,
you have more influence on the upper and left side than white has in
the lower and right -- plus some territory in the LR corner.

So, O16 is not unreasonable here, Q14 is also a possibility.
Of course, a pincer is also, as you suggest, an emminently 
reasonable possibility, probably low, to give the extra threat
of connection at S6 for life, in particular I think R11 is a 
good point.]
;B[nd];W[rd]
;C[Now that white has S16 played, this is probably 
too deep -- you should look for
a lighter reducing play rather than a sever invasion.  Even one point less 
deep
makes it far easier to escape, Q11 is far better.

To decide how far to invade, decide which white stones mark the "outposts"
of white's influence -- in this case they are P7 and R14.  Then draw an
imaginary line between them -- if your stone is below this line, then it
is probably a deep/severe invasion, and may get into trouble.  If it is
above the line, it is a shallow/light reduction.  Sitting right on the 
line is the balance point -- and generally the hardest for white to deal
with.  \(Why would you ever play a shallower move than neccessary -- well,
a shallow reduction is far more likely to end up with you finishing up
in sente which may \(is\) also important.  And you may not need the larger
reduction.

At this point in the game -- the simple response at R17 is also quite
playable.  If white doesn't follow up at Q11/R11/P14, then your invasion
at R11 looks very good \(white can't settle the R15 group with the play
of R17\) and you end up with sente, and a good chance of making territory
on the uppper side.  A play K10 after whites expected response of \(say\)
P14 looks like a lot of fun -- it looks at reducing moves on both the
lower \(say K5 or L5\) and right \(P11, P12, Q11, or even Q9\) and makes a
huge moyo \(which won't survive in anything near its entirety\) on the
whole upper left side of the board.  And it goes well with your influence
oriented choices on previous moves -- that is K16 and D10.]B[qi]
;W[qc]
(
;C[Something looks fishy in the whole sequence after this -- for both black 
and
white.  I don't like Q13, but can't quite put my finger on why.  I'd be more 
inclined to play the light jump to O11.  Yes, white can cut off the R11 stone,
but you don't need that stone -- and if white tries to cut, you can generally
get a stone \(connected\) at either R9 or R13 -- both of which are equally 
good
for reduction purposes and your concerns.  The usual "cut" sequence is shown
as a variation to the previous move.]B[pg]
;W[pf];B[og]
;C[This should probably 
be a further push at P14 -- otherwise black connects too easily,

;B[rs]C[> are there any wasted moves in

You can probably ignore the final connection at Q2 -- you still

Again, I think white is playing something unusual to throw you into 
unknown territory.  The high kakari is only, usually, played by white
if he has a lot of thickness opposite and wants to ensure that he comes
out with influence/outward facing stones, even at a small loss locally.

I think the best response to this is C14, and I follow some variations
on white responses to this move in the variations on move 33.  I'll look
at general variations, not just the one applicable to this situation.]

;C[Before white played H17, there was a tenuous connection between the K16 
and F16 stones.
Generally when white plays a move like this, it is best to play the move that 
most tries
to maintain that connection.  In this case, that would mean playing H16.

White will probably live underneath -- or possibly force his way out, but 
either
way you should end up with very good thickness here, which will be great for 
dealing
with \(capturing on a large scale\) the D14 stone.

If white had played H16 himself \(probably a more reasonable choice -- 
remember my
comments about invading, and drawing lines?\), then black would have as his

two moves to look at H17 and H15.]B[gc]

You are running a splitting attack here -- keep you moves, especially the
cutting ones, solid and sound.  Don't risk one of your cutting stones getting 
cut off,
or him escaping by making such a threat.  H12, H11, or G11 would all be 
better choices.

Remember... there is no hurry to this fight, the longer you push him around, 
all the 
time running your stones and thickness towards his influence on the bottom 
side, the
better it is for you.  You probably don't even need to kill either group, 
just run
your stones all the way down to the bottom edge -- let both groups connect, 
one to
the G3/K3 group, and the other to the Q5 group, but you've got your splitting 
group
run through to N2, plus you've made territory on the left side.

Also, that corner is still not very sound -- a play at E17 could badly mess 
with any
hope you have of making life, so the outside connection may be important for 
your group
as well.  

\(As a side note, white should probably NOT have tried to run the D14 stone.  
He should
have left it as a forcing move/weakness, and used the aji from it first, to 
run out
the H17 group more easily, and after that, to make a successful corner 
invasion --
probably at C17, but maybe at C16.\)]B[hj]

Yes, this is very icky, and EXTREMELY greedy.

The white group at H16 is already dead, you just have to keep it that way.  
You
can allow the white group at E11 to escape, because you will be able to keep 
chasing it.  A far better choice, which solves most of your problems, connects
everything up, and leaves you in good shape for any more fighting, would be
K10.  After K10, The white group \(at top\) has no hope at all.  Whereas, 
with this
play, you have reduced the liberties on you cutting stones without bringing 
them
any closer to being connected to some sort of life.

Another move that also works well, instead of K10, is K9 -- it has many of the
same effects -- connecting the H11 stones to the rest.  The differences are 
that
it strengthens the weakness at K13 a little more, but it isn't as effective 
for
moving forward in your continued attack on the D14 group.]
;W[ii]
;C[This 
should be H9 -- at least reduce the liberties on G9, then F9 will be atari.

Without a move here, your cutting stones are beginning to look awfully
isolated... there begins to be a noticeable risk that, with cutting
points at M9 and K9, that one of the outside \(cutting\) groups will 
itself be cutoff and killed.  The choice of best move here is definitely
unclear, but this one is quite a reasonable choice -- it connects the
M11 group solidly to life, and prevents any hope of either escape, or
reduction through that gap -- maybe not succeeding in connecting to
the M12 stones, but still cutting off the Q11 stones instead.  Other
possible choices here include M9, M8, N9, K8, K9, and even maybe L8.

With a bit more looking at some of the sequences, a play at M9 seems
to allow the white group at H18 to connect, but black cuts off the F11
group \(in sente\) and gets very good thickness along the outside.  A play
at M8 seems to connect everything nicely -- the M9 cutting point is the
most dangerous weakness.

The choice of O11, while not horrible, gets into trouble if white
chooses M9 as his next play.  I'll follow some of the problems and
show how black ends up in trouble in the variation.]

This actually does look like the best choice for protecting your cutting
points.  There is one still open -- at J8, but it isn't important, because
H8, J7, H8... connects up in the other direction.]
;W[mf]
;B[ne]C[> do I need

White isn't going to be able to connect through to the right side here, and 
he can't even cut the P14 stone off from one of the O16 or Q16 stones -- 
though you might lose one.

A more dangerous threat, should you ignore, is a jump to somewhere in the 
M16/M17/L17 area -- threatening to cut off and capture the black K16 and/or
K18 groups.  O15 is probably enough to render that threat harmless, and it
covers the P15 weakness as well, but there might still be complications after
white M16 -- so a play in that direction would probably have been better here.
O18 \(with the secondary benefit of reducing the value of white P18\) is one 
possibility, as are O17, N16, and M16.]

In general, this is only useful if white has to play the hane on his side of
the stone -- you then gain more territory, since you get to play the pull
back \(to C11\).  This tends to be true if white is fairly weak, or doesn't
have support near -- or if there is a trap.  Generally, the move played is
the diagonal one \(in this case C11\), or sometimes the knights-move to B11.

But, at this point in the game there is a far more important concern for
black than a play on this side \(though this is important as well\) but
the black UL corner may not be alive.  Consider the complications that
arise starting as shown in variation 1.]

Pushes like this are good as long as they are sente... if he has to respond,
it is good.  Generally anything that threatens to cut off a larger piece, or
to massively reduce, is worth playing... or later, all it has to do is 
threaten
to make more points than any other move is worth to be sente.]

;B[oo]C[> I'm

The following analysis is not actually valid, because of black N13, capturing
3 stones and connecting. but if we assume that those can't be captured,
the follow is true, and the general principles espoused are well worth
looking at.  Since white doesn't have a truly sente follow-up at the top
\(or I don't think white does\), then Q6 is probably bigger.

But A16 is probably bigger than Q6, and S12 may also be.

****

This is a fairly complicated question, but the answer \(though not obvious\)
is no.  As long as white can either finish with sente to his followup to
P18, or come out in gote, but with more points than Q6 is worth, he should
play the follow up to P18.

So, to decide, we first have to decide on the value of Q16 -- it works
out to about 15 points \(in gote, of course\).  The calculation is as 
follows:
   3 captured stones - 6
   6 points around stones that will be territory = 6
   N7 gote follow up worth 6pts x 1/2 = 3
   Total: 15
\(N7 is worth a touch under 3 actually, but there are other pushes worth about
a point as well.  15 is a good number for this.\)
   
  In variation 1, I follow the monkey jump to M19 -- black has the tesuji 
threat
at Q18 to cut off the M19 stone, but white still finishes in sente because of 
the
ability to cut of the black M16/N17/K18 group and kill it.

  In variation 2, I follow the simpler follow-up of O17 -- now black can't cut
white off, and simply has to make life, allowing white to go back and connect 
at
Q6.  

  In fact, white should play any move that threatens to make more than 15 
points
now \(and is sente, of course.\)  For instance, A16 can also be played.]

;B[gr]C[> Here amongst this endgame stuff, are there better/bigger points I'm 
> missing?

Endgames, despite being the simplest part of Go \(and they have been, 
effectively,
solved\) are still complicated.

The first, and most important, consideration in deciding what moves to play 
is 
sente.  One can't just look at the first move, and say does my opponent have 
to
respond?  One has to look at the complete sequence -- in this case, white will
respond to G2, but black will then have to play another move.  Black also has
to be careful because of the weakness at E4 -- on thing that is often an 
option
in this sort of situation is to play the descent to F2 \(threatening a monkey 
jump\)
which is more likely to be sente than the hane -- it does give up a point or 
so,
but as long as the remaining moves are worth more than 1 point, giving up one 
point
for sente is worth it.

But, in general, one should look for and play moves in the order: sente for 
both players, 
sente for me, sente for him, gote.

Or, another way of looking at it, take the value of any move, if it is 
double-sente,
multiple it be 4; if it is my sente or his sente, multiply by 2, and if it is 
gote
multiply it by 1.  Also, when deciding sente, you have to determine not just 
the size
of the move, but the size of the threat -- a 1 point sente move, where the 
threat is
worth 30 points should be played before a 4 point reverse sente move with 
only a 6pt
threat.

The single biggest move on the board right now \(for either player, since it 
is big
double sente\) is S12.

After S12, the biggest move for black is O17 -- this move is sente for white 
\(threatens
to kill the black group at M16, etc\) and makes the play of R15 sente for 
white as well.
Whereas, for black, it allows R15 \(in sente\) for black, and also makes P19 
sente for
black.  Very big.  \(Of course, R15 shouldn't be played until after S12.\)

Other big points are A16 \(reverse sente\) P4 \(sente\) and Q7 \(reverse 
sente\).]

against the philosophy of the chinese fuseki
a bit.  black wants white to invade so that he can chase white

might be to play at f16.  nonetheless, n16 is big...]B[md]

flexible position for white, and it's a shame to
"freeze" the shape \(korigatachi\) this way.  I would
prefer to see a probe at e12, e11, or c17 instead.

By the way, the strategy of sacrificing d15 in exchange
for the k16/n16 is unreasonable.  while white can harass
those stones, he can't really expect to kill them outright.

;L[mf][jf]C[reid:  I'll copy the following 
from the last game I reviewed for
you: "Another general principal of go is the fight when you have
the advantage \(and avoid fighting where you are at a disadvantage\)."
in this position, it's 8 black stones to 2 white stones.  even if
white manages to live here, he probably won't gain from it.  better
to play lighter if you must play here.  better still to leave the
aji in this area for later, and take your sente somewhere else, perhaps
the top-side fight with white n14 or k14...]W[dg]

area around m17 can never be big for either side, so
there is no real reason to play there.  if instead
black pushes white into his strength with a, and white
dives for eyes with k18 \(or l17\), white can complete his
encirclement with j10.  then black's center influence should
be enough to win.

;W[hp]C[reid: h4 is unorthodox, but it seems playable in a handicap game.]
;B[ce]C[reid: here I think I'd rather see black respond to white's h4.
      Even though h4 isn't much of an attack, d4 is more under
      attack than d17 is.  Perhaps black d6 or c6 would work well here.]
;W[hn]C[
 realtek 5k*: net lag 2 long here
reid: Also highly unorthodox, and not really playable, I think :-\)
      The general principle is to play corners first, sides second,
      and the center last, so h6 isn't really an important point 
      to be playing so soon]
;B[jc]C[
 osman 3k*: what time is it exactly
 realtek 5k*: its PM 9 here
reid:  This might give white a chance to make h6 be a good move.
       It seems to me that k17 isn't really addressing either
       the moyo white is building, or a white attack at d6.]
;W[lq]C[reid: 
This feels a bit awkward to me.  The relation between
       m3 and q5 is rather poor.  White d6 \(to start a fight\),
       q3 \(to build the moyo and take the corner\), or something
       around q12 \(to build the moyo on the largest possible
       scale and to lead towards w o16\) all seem like better
       choices to me.]L[dn][pq][ph]
;B[pq]C[
 osman 3k*: strange, off by nonexact number of hours
 osman 3k*: it's 8:25 here
reid:  Black can certainly invade this corner now, but he
       doesn't need to rush in so soon, either.  Playing
       at c/d6 or q/r 10 would also be fine \(and a bit more
       consistant\).]
;W[qf]C[reid: Black has just invaded white's sphere of 
influence.
      I think white should take his profit now.  Another
      general principal of go is the fight when you have the
      advantage \(and avoid fighting where you are at a 
      disadvantage\).  In the lower right, w has a two to one
      numerical advantage in stones.  If he lets b play first
      here, the advantage becomes 1-1, a significant decrease.
      My strategy would be to force black to live in the corner
      here while I build strength in sente, then to play r/q 14
      \(or perhaps r/q 13/12 to make sure he doesn't invade\).  Perhaps
      white could try for the variation here.]
(
;C[reid:  This might be a good 
time for the pincer. See variation.]B[nd]
(
;W[pj]
;B[ck]C[reid: Closer to the 
lower left corner \(like c6 or c7\)
      would make it a bit harder for white to invade.]
;W[cm]C[reid: When 
invading a high/low position like black
      d4-c9, it's usually best to be closer to the
      high stone, d4 in this case.  I think c6 would
      work a bit better than c7.  One way to think
      about this is that c9 is stronger \(since it's on
      the third line\) than d4.  A very important go
      proverb is: "Play away from strength", or to turn
      it around, play closer to the weaker.  In this
      position, d4 looks weaker.]
;B[ek]
;W[fq]C[reid: white seems to be 
abandoning c7 with this
      move.  Just running out with a move around
      e7 seems more natural.  F7 is too close to
      h4/6.  Again, play away from strength.]
;B[eo]C[reid: At the risk of 
getting repetitive, e5 should
      be closer to the weaker.  Instead of trying to
      but into the over-strong position of w f3-h4-h6,
      b should just surround the weak white c7 with
      d6 or e6. ]
;W[ec]C[reid: w should take advantage of b's mistake and come
      out at e7.  After w e7, it looks like white has
      the numerical advantage in the corner fight.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[cb];W[dd];B[cc];W[fb];B[da]
;W[ge]C[reid: a standard "light" sequence for w here.]
;B[gc]
;W[hc]C[reid: h17 looks good.  f17 is too heavy, of course.]
;B[hd]
;W[oc]C[reid: white seems to be having trouble
      making up his mind :-\)]
;B[od]
;W[ic]C[reid: This looks like a dangerous 
move to me.
      Continuing the light play with j16
      might be better.  Or sacrificing h17
      by cutting at g16 might work too.]
;B[id]C[reid: Hmm, I think b g18 
would be more severe here.
      If white cuts at g16 \(after b g18\), then j16
      would be terrible for w.  Therefore, w will
      probably want to come out at j16 instead of
      cutting at g16.  B can respond to j16 by coming
      leading white out with h15.  Black probably 
      doesn't mind white getting strong in this area
      since he already answered p17 firmly with p16.]
;W[jb]
;B[jd]C[reid: 
Still not too late for b g18 \(instead of k16\).]
;W[kb]
;B[nc]C[reid: B n18 
would be more difficult for white to deal with.
      This is one case where "closer to the weaker" doesn't
      apply.  The reason it doesn't is because p17 is *too*
      weak already.  N18 is a vital spot for the eye shape
      of the k18 group.]
;W[gb];B[fc];W[ed];B[gd];W[ef];B[dg]
;W[ld]C[reid: If 
b were on n18 now, white would be in trouble.
      At the very least, b would be able to solidify
      his outside wall in sente, leaving the e14
      stones in a terrible jam.]
;B[le];W[mb]
;B[nb]C[reid: The clamp at m17 
looks much bigger to me.  Blocking
      with o18 is really small when you consider that
      white can still play s16.  If you are undercut on
      both sides, it's pretty hard to keep any territory.
      On the other hand, if b makes his outside wall solid,
      the e14 stones will suffer greatly.]
;W[me];B[lc];W[kc];B[kd];W[md];B[mc];W[lf]
;B[ke]C[reid: Woah! Doesn't black want to kill white?  I know
      the pon-nuki is supposed to be worth 30 points,
      but it doesn;t seem to be that big in this case,
      and killing white *is* worth 30 points.  See
      variation.]
(
;W[lb];B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[gg]
;C[reid: This is too small. 
Black is only getting a little bit
      more territory around e11 than he was already getting.
      Better to attack on a large scale, with G11. Even better
      would be to pre-empt white's attack on the corner with
      e7.  And even better would be to settle the lower right
      with r5, o3, or n3.  P5 might also be possible.]B[fh]
;W[hh]
;C[reid: 
Still too small for b.  These stones aren't contributing
      much to black's overall board position, but with each move
      by white, the g13 group is getting stronger.  It seems
      to me that the weak white group is a resource for black,
      but that by playing this way, he isn't getting his maximum
      potential from that resource.]B[gi]
;C[reid: This move seems to miss the 
point somewhat.
      If white wants to re-inforce here, then q13
      would be sente, at least.  But the center
      stones are still too weak for white to play
      this kind of gote move.]W[ph]
;L[ij]C[reid: This move doesn't seem 
to have any real relation
      to the other black stones.  How about chasing the
      center stones some more with j10?  They probably
      won't die, but by the time the chase is over,
      white won't have much center moyo left.]B[nj]
;W[cf];B[df]
;C[reid: Where 
did this come from?  This should have
      no hope of living.  It should only help black
      get strong on the outside.]W[cg]
;B[be];W[dh];B[eh];W[dj]
;C[reid: Well, 
this looks like a vital point all right,
      but it's too soon.  Just connect at d9 and white
      should die naturally.

      The original invasion goes against the principle
      of fighting where you have an advantage, and
      avoiding fights where you're at a disadvantage.]B[ci]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[di];B[ch];W[dl]

;B[pb]C[R15/Q15 is more 
important than here.  You aren't going to kill the corner -- and
a play at Q18 can not connect to the O17 stone -- so the most important point 
in
this sequence is the mutual weakness at R15/Q15.  

In fact, it is double sente, so both players should take it before most of the
other plays in the next few moves.]
;W[kc]
;B[ke]C[This should be the simple 
block at K17 -- by playing up/out like this, you make it 
too easy for the white group to make a base. 

The sequence played along the right is supposed to give white some \(small\) 
amount
of territory in the corner in exchange for black outside thickness.  The way 
you
take advantage of thickness, is by attacking groups -- in this case the white 
stones
at L17&O17.  If you play K17, they will have no base -- and they will have to 
run
out into the centre, this is what you want... to chase a weak white group 
into the
centre.  

In fact, L17 is a poor choice for white... he should abandon the O17 stone, 
leaving
the aji behind for later, and play elsewhere.  It was a sacrifice stone to 
gain the
territory in the corner inside blacks sphere of influence.]
;W[ne]
;B[oe]C[You 
are better off playing the simple connection at Q15 here -- it makes R15 far 
nastier
sente against the white corner group.  White probably won't be able to play 
the extension
to R13 after all, and will have to make a more conservative response, freeing 
you to play
something important like \(still\) K17 or possibly O13.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[jc]
;B[id]C[I would probably hane at J17 here.  Keep white low.]
;W[ic]
;B[lc]C[ 
fmaus 23k :  risky? or a good attack?

This looks like an overplay to me.  Even if the white response of M16 
doesn't work, the response at M18 is going to, and white is going to
come out with reasonable shape and eye-space, for little gain to you.

Because of the pushes at K17 and then J17, this group is solid enough
that it isn't going to die, and you might chop off the O15 stone -- but
so what?  Your best bet at this point is to try and cramp its size as
much as possible -- the hane at H17 is still probably your best choice.

\(Do you sense a theme here, I keep having you try and block white's
movement towards the left.  Must be important.\)]

And, of course, you got to experience just how painful letting white get this
move was. ]
;B[hc]C[ fmaus 23k : oh my, why am i in this fight so soon :\)

Because you made an overplay at M17...]
;W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fc];W[jp]
;B[dj]C[This should be at F18.  If white ignore, L18 kills the white group.  So, 
F18 is
sente, and it seals the corner, making territory and making the black group on
the outside far more solid.  Then black can make a play on this side.

At this point, I would prefer the kakari at C6 to the D10 extension 
I can't pin down why, it just looks better.  I guess D10 feels too slow.]
;W[cf]C[This is a bit of an overplay by white -- but he got away with his 
last overplay
\(L17\) so why not try again.  If white must invade, A point like D14 or D12 
is 
probably better.]
;B[ce];W[df]
;B[fe]C[This is the wrong direction... white 
can't connect to his own group on this side,
he is already cut.  And killing the stone at H16 isn't important for black -- 
you
don't need that connection to live on either side.  Yes, if white plays H15, 
you
will have to respond \(to maintain the life of the J16 stones, which is 
important to
maintain the cut\) but you shouldn't be playing on this side.  The move that 
really
stands out to me is C12.  Then white, again, has no base and has to run with 
a black
wall already built on one side... and there is even a black wall accross the 
top 
to prevent white escaping that way... Things get messy for white.]
;W[ci];B[cj]

worth doing.]
;W[gf];B[hf]
;W[jj]C[This move doesn't feel right -- there seems 
to be bigger stuff around.  Black isn't
going to make much territory in the centre anyway, and neither is white... so

a nice
choice -- especially the left side.]
;B[fh];W[eh]
;B[gi]C[ fmaus 23k :  This

Way too cautious... in fact, at this point you could, quite easily, tenuki...
or if you want to continue putting pressure on this white group, E11 is a 
better choice.  This move looks very odd.

And an even better choice than either outside move is a play at B14 or B15.]
;W[be]C[ fmaus 23k :  okay, this wont kill my corner because of e17 & h16

Yes, this won't kill your corner -- but the white group is now alive.  The 
question,
of course, is where to move to.]
;B[dn]C[ fmaus 23k :  would r6 be better? or 
f3,q3?

Both of r6 and f3 would be better.  I don't think Q3 is right,
it is too much commitment to living in corner, while the outside
is still open.  If white had a stone at Q7/Q8, then maybe Q3.

I think I like F3 best of all the choices.  With you having played G11,
your D10 group doesn't have to be shepherded all that much, so making
the tiny extension at D6 isn't needed.]

has moves in wrong order by both players.]
;B[cp]C[This should be a connection 
for C2 cutting point -- either C2, or maybe B2.

C2, white connects E3, then black makes the push to C4.\)]
;W[do]C[This should 
be the cut/capture at C2.  It greatly improves white's position, and is 
worth more than this push.]
;B[co]C[Well, this might, finally, be bigger than 
C2.  ]
;W[en]C[ fmaus 23k :  f3 bad? not sure of sit here.

As to F3 being bad -- I commented on it at the time, I feel it was
an overplay -- but you haven't come out of this horribly badly right now.]
;B[em]C[C2 is still bigger than this... and this move forces white to make 
good shape with
F7, while leaving you setup for a double atari.  Just leave this stone \(D6\) 
alone.
If white ataris from top, you connect, then you can connect underneath at B7 
should
white try to push and cut.  And, remember if white does atari at D7, it will 
be gote
because of the cutting point at E7 for you.]

;W[eq]C[ fmaus 23k

Not sure if this is directly on this move... but no, this is the normal
response by white to the move at C2.  And your connection at C6 was 
important for the stability of the black groups as well.]
;B[fr]C[This move is 
aji-keshi.  It won't work, and it doesn't gain you any points -- in fact
it loses you points by throwing away the sente hane at E1.  This local

the E7 stone
and play elsewhere.]
;W[es];B[el];W[fl]
;B[fk]C[You shouldn't be playing these

;B[pn]C[ flyboy 21k*: q6!! good move

Finally a comment from flyboy that I agree with.  Yes, Q6 is the right point 
here.
R6 would be too low, and a corner invasion would be wrong.]
;W[nq]C[ flyboy 
21k*: o3 too passive

Absolutely correct -- far better choices for white here would be O4, O5, or
because of the relative weakness of the black stones, white might even get
away with P6.  Actually, I quite like P6.

 flyboy 21k*: o5 good for you now

O5 is definitely the right direction for your next move -- the other 
possibilities are O6 and N6.

A third option that might be interesting, would be the contact play at P4.

also big -- but can black kill the corner?]
;B[qh];W[rh]
;B[qi]C[R11 not a good 
move.  This gains you almost nothing -- you will still be able
to maintain your connection if you play elsewhere \(and if you actually need 
that
connection\) and anything in the area of N6 is huge compared to this.

 flyboy 21k*: L11 seems good for you now
 flyboy 21k*: to try and make some territory

L11 is too small/slow.  In fact, even N6 might not be far enough, and you 
might
want to play an invasion reducing play likc M4.  In fact, M4 is looking better
all the time.  M4 is the punishment for white playing O3 instead of O4/O5.
 flyboy 21k*: r7 good point for white]
;W[nn]C[Oh well.  Unless you can kill 
something fairly substantial, the game is over now.]
;B[li]C[Not going to be 
enough, and not deep enough.  White will be happy to wall you off
with N9, and take his territory -- in fact, he is making territory faster than
you are.  You should try to play on the border of the influence at times like 
this -- rather than on your side of the border.  At this point, a play at M8 
would
have been about right.  \(Remember my previous comments about drawing a line
between the outside posts of the wall, and play on that line.  Well, K10 and
O6 are the outer posts, and M8 is right on that line.\)  Here you might even
get away with slightly overstepping the line with M7, but not much more.]

making white's wall stronger, and leaving the
jump in available if needed for reduction.]
;B[jh]
;W[hj]C[Black should ignore 
this -- it is just white completing his wall on this side -- and black
has almost no territory to make here.  At this point, the centre is basically 
finished,
there are only small moves now.  N9 is probably still a good choice, because 
it is sente
against the white position -- but black can not play a gote move, since there 
are 
important big moves elsewhere.  For instance, S10 is large, as is S3.]
;B[hi]C[
 fmaus 23k :  too small? I'm looking at his cutting points, but still may be
2 small
 flyboy 21k*: h11 just helps white and gains nothing
 flyboy 21k*: yes]
;W[kj]C[White should never play this.  N9 covers this 
weakness, and it is worth more.

In fact, white should never have gotten into this bad shape -- playing H10 at
J9 would have worked far better.]
;B[gj];W[hk]
;B[mh]C[ fmaus 23k :  again, 
must I protect, or do I have sente?

No you don't have to protect -- white's only threat starts with J12 -- and 
you can just
respond with K13, and there is no risk at all.  You are protecting the two or 
so points
at J12 and J13 at the cost of sente.  Not worth doing.  N9 is still reaonably 
large,
but now S10 is probably the biggest thing around.  \(Though it is a toss-up 
between 
S10 and S3 -- both are huge, and both look double-sente-ish.\)

And if you absolutely MUST connect, connect at N11, that way you severely 
reduce
the value of white N9 -- N9 no longer threatens an atari, so you are much 
more 
free to ignore it.]
;W[rq]C[ fmaus 23k :  ouch, that's big, ain't it?

Yup.]
;B[rp]C[S4 is awful shape -- another reason to play S3 first.  ]
;W[mk]C[Even without N12, you have to ignore this.  S10 is far larger -- and will be
until that corner/side is resolved.  In fact, black should be playing against 
that
corner now, rather than later.]
;B[nj]C[ fmaus 23k :  can I hane? I don't 
think so...

Wrong question.  Is this \(white's move\) sente is the correct
question, and the answer is no.

 flyboy 21k*: p4 is last chance to get into moyo

P4 doesn't break into the moyo -- it reduces a little, but is risky because
of the bad shape in the R4 stones.

\(Proper play after Black P4 is white P3.  Now black ends in gote.\)]
;W[qb]C[Ooops white got here first as well...]
;B[qe]
;W[re]C[ fmaus 23k :  ko time,

Well, R8 would have been worth more than 6 points.  For you.

because it costs you a liberty.

This game is dominated by all-out fighting, something
both players seem to be strong at.  My advice, to both
players, is to be a bit less obsessed with killing and
look after your own weak groups before starting heavy
attacks on the opponent, since it often pays off in the
long run to be patient.  Also remember that a successful
attack doesn't necessarily mean to kill the enemy group.

instead, which makes miai of capturing the
single black stone in good shape with 'b' or
the two black stones with 'c'. If black pushes
at 'd', white follows once at 'e' and still
threatens to capture using 'f'. It would allow
Black to link together his stones by playing
34 himself, but White's resulting strength
would dominate the center and support invasions
on the lower side. White would also have good

;C[Until here a perfectly normal fuseki. White will normally play
either A \(Q7\) or B \(R7\). A makes a better connection with C \(R10\).
R6 is playable, though, but White should probably have continued
in another way \(see continuation in variation b\) after Blacks invasion. The 
Pl
ayed

where to play next. if black answers R15, White can reduce the
outside with the possibility of a life in the corner later \(the
life would be gote though, so it's not too large. If black anaswers
in the corner \(R17 or S17, White can play R15 to get some sabaki.]W[rd]
;C[Again good move, a punishment for whites defiance to answer N5.
Both players play very aggressive. White cannot omit an asnwer here,
since blac P2 as followup woulc kill the corner.]B[mq]
;C[All right, it's an 
answer, but probably the worst thinkable
\(apart from abandoning the group. Black should play N2 \(I
think immediately\), since it threatens a flower-viewing ko

;C[Though the sequence played seems 
natural, white has gotten a weak
group here, while giving black extremely good prospects in the lower
right.
White Should of course play ko here, this is not a flower-viewing one, in that
black would lose a much too. Dur to the bad shape, nearly every black play 
aroun
d
P14 is sente \(threatening to kill white, so black
gets very thick here.]W[rg]

;C[Just asks black to take territory while 
trying to get out of the
enclosure.]W[oe]
;B[md]
;C[Whites play until now wasn't especially good, but 
this move is
probably the worst done by white. It's a 10-point gote move,
that gives black tremendous thickness. Since the white group
in the corner is absolutely safe now, there really is no reason to make
such a abad move.]W[lq]
;B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[ms]
(
;C[Black could try to kill 
white by playing Q14, but this would
probably be to much to expect. This is a good, relaxed way of
playing, though I would have preferred O13. this move doesn't
leave any white escape routes into the black framework, and if white answers
O13 by N15, black just plays M16 to take more territory on the fourth
line.]B[nf]
;C[This is probably the best white play, though it really
hurts to have to live like this.]W[pf]
;C[Wrone direction of play. There are 
three problems with this move:

1\) It's much too cleose to the black thickness above, which doesn't work
to it's fullest. Black should get some territory on the left side first,
by playing C6 for instance. If White tried to get away with sente
\(C6-F3-B4-C9-E16\), black coule attack white with
B2, since white doesn't have two eyes in the corner then. There is the basic
proniple: use thickness to attack, DON'T use thickness to build territory.

2\) The followup to O14 is somehwhere in the upper left corner \(D16, E16 
,E17 o
r
F16. Thereby black can build an enourmous framework, which would be consistent
with his strategy so far.

3\) This point is not only wrong directed, there is really no one
who really would want to play here \(White approaching black thickness
--> White does get a weak group and little prospects,
Black approaching White from this site:
--> White gets a strong group here, while blacks territorial prospects
don't match the amount of stones invested.]B[fp]
;C[Maybe better at C7, though 
it could be just a matter of taste.]W[fq]
;B[gq];W[eq]
;C[Black has invested 
very many stones \(7 + 2 captured\), to surround
~15 points. In the meantime white has secured a
corner that is bigger than 15 points, with just three stones!!!!

Black should either have taken the corner instead of the approach move
or otherwise should have approached from hte other side.]B[gp]
;C[? D6 is of 
course the point to play.]W[cn]
;B[en]
;C[Black is much to strong after the 
N2,N3-capture. If Black plays
S6 now, white is in dire straits. White could have played s6, to
see, if black is satisfied with q6, though it's probably still
too much to expect.]W[on]

been followed by s6. Still white does have bleak p
rospects.]B[oo]

;C[This move merely helps 
white. The intention must be to secure some terri
tory
around the lower black group, but in the meantime black hurts his own 'small'
group between the two white ones. Black should play as shoed in the

blacks overly concern with territory at L8. Furthermore
an attack against the black group above does seem possible.]W[mj]

as white can fight back strongly with o8.]B[ml]
;W[nl];B[mm]
;C[? White had a 
fine counter going on, and black could have done nothing
\(useful\) against n6 - of course he could runawawy at n9, but then
white could make a counter attack against the black group above.
White took the initiative with o8
only to let it slip away again. Still blacks group above seems to
come under attack soon.]W[nk]
;C[This is slack. If white continues with 
m9,n6,j9, blacks
moyo is in ruins and he has no further prospects of getting anything
in the center. And in the meantime white got a big corner around D4.]B[oj]

in turn seems like an overplay\). Should have been C5-D7-J16.]W[dn]

connect at e7\) and can play the combination named before to try
to get the whole upper side.]W[bm]

black. the
low and stable position of white at C14 means, that blacks thickness
is cancelled out, so white can invade the upper side after blacks 
connection.]B[bl]

upper side.]W[ci]
;C[Finally one player tries to enclose the upper side, but

much too loose. should have been the combination mentioned before

;C[? White urges black to strengthen the upper side, 
as to make
an invasion harder? White may be aiming at some aji above, but I
can't see any way as to utilize aji, if black just plays n15.

;L[hq][de]C[reid:  the general feeling about the chinese fuseki
seems to be that white needs to be aggressive about
reducing the moyo.  white c15 is a bit slow in that
regard.  something like a \(h3\) or invading somewhere
around p5 might be more to the point \(see "The Chinese
Opening" by Kato Masao for some ideas on how to invade
around there\).

Also, c15 seems like it might be better played high, at
b \(d15\).  That seems to work better both with the upper
white formation and with the stone at c3 \(since c3 is
also low\).]W[ce]

wrong direction.  the normal
joseki has white playing a \(e2\) next.  I think that's
what white wants to do anyway, to reduce blacks moyo
a bit.  black turning at c5 isn't a problem for white
since he already has c15 to keep this area small.  also,
if black turns at c5, that stone doesn't work very well
with his moyo on the right.  if he plays at b \(g4\) it seems
a bit odd in relation to k4.]W[co]

he makes a bamboo joint, then he can aim at attacking 
black's h11 stones while reducing the black moyo.

g13 stones to get his h11 stones out of trouble.]L[fh]W[gg]

Dear Bill,
My impression is that your opponent was playing greedy, omitting important
moves to get the big points first. It is not a good style and will result
in very poor result if counter-attacked properly. But you made some small
moves in the beginning that let your opponent fix his weakness.
I suggest that you pay more attention to the security of each group \(both
yours and your opponent's\) and make your plan according to
that.]FF[3]

Hi everyone!

It's an undeserved honor but a great pleasure to present a series of
Ancient Chinese Go games here.

The games were played in the year 1739, when my great great great
grandfather was openning a small tea shop somewhere in Southern China :).
The two players, Fan and Shi, were among the most famous ones in Chinese Go
history.  Their fighting strength are said to be stronger than some pro 9
dans of today, and they were called, fittingly, "great national hands"
(ever heard of an artistic term for "playing go" -- "hand talk"?).

Both players were born at a same county, which was exactly the same place
where these game were played.  The county was called "Ping Hu", also known
as "Dang Hu", and these games were concequently called "Dang Hu Games."

In this year, 1739, Fan was 31 years old, and Shi 30.  Both were at their
prime time.  These games showed their extraordinary skills and imagination;
these games were not only the Go Bible of those days, but even today, they
are regarded as the best classic work of Go in China.

They played more than 10 games, but it seems to be a tradition that people
prefer round numbers for important collections.  Today, for example, they
have the annual "top ten news of the year", and fans vote for the "top ten
athletics of the year", etc. in China.  Same thing happened to these "Dang
Hu Games"; people later only collected 10 of them.

But aren't 10 enough?  I think every single game could bring us enough
excitement.  To make it a lasting event, I won't post 10 games altogether;
I will post one game every two or three days. (Hey that's a good excuse.
The truth is, I just finished the editing of the comments on Game 1 :-)

The comments are based on a book written by Chinese pro 9 dan Mr. Chen
Zu-De, who was once the number one Go player in China before the younger
Nie.  My translation could be full of mistakes (which many people can't
find :-), and for those who *can* see the mistakes, I will be greatly
appreciated if you point them out.

Finally, actually most importantly, I wouldn't have started to do this if I
were not inspired by players on IGS (Internet Go Server; if you have not
heard it, I am sorry you have missed an half year of fun).  In fact, to
express my special thanks to people (related to Go) who have greatly
influenced me, I will dedicate each editted game to a person (anyone on
IGS, watch out :-).

Enough said.  Better read the games than my words. :)

jzy, NR ^_^

;B[pf]C[Shi, in one of his book on Go theories, explained the direction of B #12.  If O16, after W N16, B O15, and W P17, W will be able to play K17, a good point since it salso presses B F17.  Therefore, the correct direction for B #12 isQ14, as Fan played here.]

;C[From today's point of view, to play this move at E13 is enough, since no matter how strong B \(potential\) is here, W's top group is not in any danger to be attacked.  Yet Fan and Shi thought E13 instead of F13 would be "weak."]W[fg]
;B[hc];W[id]
;C[This is a planned move when B played H17.  However, it seems that B should make an exchange at J18 with W K18 first.]B[de]
;W[ee];B[ed]
;C[Only move.  If C15 atari, B D17 gets the corner easily.]W[dc]
;B[ce];W[eg];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[bd]C[Correct.  B C17 then E17 \(with W C18 in between\) can't kill W easily \(W may manage to create a ko\) and could leave a burden for B himself.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hd];W[cb];B[ch]
;W[ib]C[B's group doesn't have complete eyeshape, so B will have to escape.  On the other hand, W's top group is as solid as a rock, and there is no way for B to take advantage of.  \(Shi, playing W, later pointed out that B should have played J18 before E16.  Had he did, B would be in a much better shape.\)]
;B[hf];W[ec];B[fd];W[hh]
;C[Too strong.  J13 to settle the top group is emergent.  The left B group, although thin, is not in immediate danger.]B[di]
;C[B's situation is now worse.]W[ig]
;B[ie];W[ei];B[ej]
;C[W E11 and F11 prevent W G12 and create D10 cut as well.]W[fi]
;C[If B protects D10 here, W J14 and B can't escape.  But K14 is not good.  Should be at J14 and B needs just one more move to live.]B[jf]
;W[dj]
;C[If E9, W has B13 and this B group would be dead.]B[bi]
;W[ne];B[od]
;C[If W O15 was played at E9 to capture B E10 stone, W would be already in a commanding lead.  But Shi is showing a good Go spirit here: if he could attack, he wouldn't turn conservative; if he could win more, he wouldn't be satisfied to win less.  O15 and O14 are extremely strong.]W[nf]
;B[og];W[lf];B[ab];W[da];B[jg]
;C[W moves are tight and strong, taking good advantage of B's weak groups.]W[oh]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[oi];W[jh];B[kh]
;C[Good move to cut B.]W[lh]
;B[ki];W[kg];B[gg];W[li];B[gh];W[gi];B[kj]
;C[Force B to live with gote.  Then Q12.]W[ij]
;B[ge];W[ph]
;C[Struggling persistently.]B[nj]
;C[Too careless.  Should play R10 -- if B Q10, W S10 and B has to play S18 to save the corner, and B's middle group is in trouble; if B S10 against W R10, W has Q10 and B is difficult.]W[pj]
;C[Now both sides are on "tiger's back," the situation becomes complicated.]B[pi]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[pk];B[pl];W[ok]
;C[Should S7 directly.  W would have to play P8, then B plays N9.  B would be better than he actually played.]B[nk]
;W[ol];B[rm];W[pm];B[rl]
;C[If S6, B would be able to increase liberties to kill W group.]W[rj]
;B[rk]
;C[If T11 instead, B can S12 peak first and leave a big aji at the corner while use sente to play somewhere else \(to get the lower right corner, for example\).]W[rh]
;B[sj];W[si];B[ri];W[nl];B[lj];W[rj];B[me];W[mg];B[ri]
;C[W O8 and N9 are doing two things: one, they are ko threats; two, they make B stones heavy.]W[mk]
;B[mj];W[rj];B[mc]
;C[Correct.  If N18, B later has M15 to create two more ko threats.]W[le]
;B[ri];W[ni];B[mi];W[rj];B[qo];W[sk]
;C[B gets the corner, quite a profit...]B[qp]
;C[...but W gets sente to attack B's middle group.  It's still W's game.]W[kl]
;B[jk]
;C[Seems strange, but it's deeper than one expects upon first look.  B is likely to atari at H13, and W J12.  Now, B probably would play K16 to save two W stones, and W gains J7.  Without the move at J14 \(and thus J12\), W J7 wouldn't work since B would have J11 and H9 \(with B H11 in between\).]W[if]

;C[No choice.  If K5, B H3 is strong.]W[ip]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[ko];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[mo]
;C[If N6, B O6 cut is good.  After W P6, M5 is sente for B, so B's lower group is out of danger and B can play F4.]W[oq]

;B[nk]C[Seems to be casual.  Q5 would be sharp.]

;B[np]C[Since W P5 created a cutting point at N6, B has to connect at O4.  With this exchange, B's future activity at the corner has been limited.]
;W[ok];B[nj]
;W[oj]C[W P9 and P10 look mediocre, but W really can't go with other choices.  Q7 \(instead of O9\) seems to be a move to defend here, but the result isn't quite clean -- B has S6 to live the corner.]
;B[qn]C[Slightly late.]
;W[rn]PL[W]C[Now if B plays R5, W S5 is good and B can't live here.]
;B[ri]C[W has to be careful here.  If W casually plays S12, B has Q11 sente.  After W R12 and B O11, W has to play M9 and B would have a good move at Q7.  That would be a big headache to W.]

;B[op];W[pq];B[po];W[om];B[ro]
;C[The corner is not settled.  However, if B plays the corner now, although he could create a ko or live with seki, he doesn't have ko threats or, with seki, he would lose sente.  So a better choice for B is to play somewhere else.]W[rm]
;B[ni];W[lk]

;C[Let B to save a few stones \(R9 etc.\).  Smart choice.  If W plays Q11 instead, B now can live the corner with seki *without* losing sente -- B would have Q8 \(now Q8 is not a threat because of W R4\).]W[qp]
;C[To here, W gets 20 plus points at the lower right.  B gains some outside potential, but this potential has been damaged by W M9.  Plus the faulty B S11, it can be judged that W is leading.]B[pj]

;B[kq]
;W[kr]C[If W plays this move directly at J5, it's already W's advantage.  L2 is tight, leaving little breathing room for B.

Editor: L2 is not just good; it's deep.  Chen 9p used nine variation diagrams to explain why L2 is good.  Unfortunatly, I am unable to include all these variation here since gasoline today is so expensive. :\) Hope I *will* be able to include them when I re-edit these comments.]

Overview: B had some loss in the lower right corner fight.  With the resulting advantage, W frequently attacked B with tight and clever moves.

;B[gd];W[hd]
;C[B G16 and G14 prevent W from cutting at F16.  Important.]B[gf]
;W[jh];B[ji]
;C[Casual.  H12 would be a good shape -- after B K14, *then* G13.  W would be a much better shape.]W[gg]
;B[hh];W[hg]
;C[B H12 and J11 severe.  B now controls teh middle, while giving W only a narrow way to escape.  B's profit is remarkable.]B[ii]
;C[Extremely painful but no other choice.  Let B play here and W would lose an eye.]W[jf]
;B[kf];W[fi]
;C[In this battle, due to some awkward plays by W, especially a casual move at G13, B is clearly better.]B[dj]
;C[F9 would be a "text move," but that would give B no pressure.  E9 is clearly a challenge to B.]W[ek]
;C[B probably likes to play E10 then F9 cut.  But the situation would be very complicated adn B decides to avoid such a not-so-sure fight.  Thus, however, B gives W a break.]B[dm]

;W[of];B[og];W[oh];B[pg];W[nk];B[oj];W[pi];B[ng];W[ok]
;C[Urgent.  In this fight, W captures O11 five B stones, forming potential at the middle. B corner is big, but not clean yet.  Therefore, it can be judged that W has gained back his loss during the upper left corner fight.]B[pc]

;W[ep]
;C[Captures two W stones.  Important.]B[en]
;C[W F4 is probably casual again \(it was said Fan often played without much thinking -- playing fast, that is -- thus making some casual mistakes once in a while\).  D3 for W here is a text move.

;B[pj];W[qj]
;C[B Q10 and P5 prepare for some future moves, but lost too much of territory -- deep moves but unnecessary at this point.  S12 to secure 50 plus points at the upper right seem to be better, and make things simpler.]B[oo]

;C[H3 seems to be B's sente to gain some profit...]B[hq]
;W[go];B[gn]
;C[...but after W G5 and H4, B doesnt' have strong moves to follow.  B H3 should O4 directly, saving H3 variation.]W[hp]
;C[Still good move, but B has been hurt at the bottom.]B[np]
;C[Losing move.  Should E3 first.  After B D2, *then* M3, thus to capture two B stones \(G3 and H3\) *cleanly*.  After that, if W can gain sente in the lower right fight, he can then have some plays at upper right.  This way, W would have a chance.]W[lq]

;C[On first look, N6 is quite incomprehensible.  Only after careful calculation that N6 is found to be an extraordinary move.  W is likely to play M7, but after B M8, B would be able to use O10 six stones to either create a ko or even save them back.]B[mn]

Overview: Although both sides have questionable moves, good moves are remarkably remarkable. :\)  The spectacular fight around the upper right corner, and B #160 \(N6\), are moves that can't be thought of by ordinary players.  Shi and Fan were truly "great national hands."]

;W[of];B[mc]
;W[lq]C[Invasion to initiate a fight.  So far it's almost the same as Game 6, which was won by Shi \(played B too\).  It's understandable that Shi preferred the same openning, but Fan also decided to go with it -- he was of course prepared.  For example, an exchange of W P14 and B N17 \(more pressure on B R9\) before W M3.]
;B[no];W[kp];B[jp];W[kn];B[jo];W[ko];B[im]
;W[pr]C[Another improvement by Fan.  In Game 6, Fan played P3 and lost advantage in the early going.]
;B[eq]C[B does not play P2 but plays E3 instead, showing his aggressive attitude.  W Q2 hoped B to play P2 but failed, so later Fan improved this move once again: W would play Q2 right after W L4, then, without B K4, K5, and J7 stones, B is not strong enough to attack W left, so B would have to play P2 and W Q2 would get what he wants.]
;W[er];B[dr]
;W[fr]C[Although W E2 and F2 were common plays, but not appropriate under this situation.  Fan, playing W, later preferred E2 and E4 \(not F2\) to gain outside thickness, while Shi preferred W H3 \(not E2\), B F2, and W G2.  Both disagreed with W's plays in this game.  Now B has sente.]
;B[en]C[Attack, but somewhat "shallow."  B D9 would be good.  Then W C2 \(after B D9\) is good order, followed by B C3, a text move.  After that, \(W first\) D1, D3, F7, and C8.  Although B corner is hurt, he gains quite a bit at the left.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl]
;B[gm]C[Only move.]
;W[cr]C[Leave some aji at the corner; good timing.]

;B[mr]C[If M2 instead, after W N2, B L3, and W M4, B N1 would be a good move to create a ko.  Unfortunately for B, W has G9 and later F10 to create several ko threats, and B can't win the ko.  So he chose N2 instead of M2.]

;B[io];W[hn];B[ho];W[go]
;B[ek]C[B temporarily doesn't have enough ko threats, so it's necessary to defend here.  If not, W has E9, after B F10, W C6 is good move.]
;W[iq];B[kr];W[jr];B[ef];W[gc];B[qq];W[pq]
;B[qn]C[B R3 adn R6 are clever moves, but wrong time!  B R3 should play L2.  Since B now has plenty of ko threats, B would be able to thicken his outside.  *Then* R6 would be much more powerful.]

;B[kr]C[Already late.]
;W[mq]C[Good move.]
;B[or];W[ms];B[nr]
;W[hp]C[To here, W not only "finishes" the ko, but also leave some weakness in B's shape.]
;B[pm]
;W[om]C[Atari at R5 instead would be a mediocre moe.  After \(B first\) S6, P7, Q8, and P6, when B N9, W would have to play L10, and B S5 would almost kill W corner.  Even if W would escape, there is no way for W to win.]
;B[pl]
;W[on]C[P7 and P6 are the only moves.]
;B[mk];W[kj]
;B[ol]C[P8 seems to be a text move, but it's almost the losing move.  B should play R5.  It \(R5\) doesn't just gain profit, but more importantly, it's directly related to the life/death of B's right.]
;W[rn];B[qo]
;C[W S6 and then R4 is a technique.]W[qp]
;C[No choice.  If S5, W would play S7 and B's liberties are one shorter.]B[rm]
;C[W gets the corner, plus L10 "sticking out," B is hurt badly. Also, B's right is not clean.  W has turned it around.]W[ro]
;C[Important.  Otherwise W C3 and B5 can live the corner, and B's territory would be definitely short.]B[cl]
;W[nm];B[ll]
;C[If W O7 or this Q10 played at R11, W would be enough.  Now Q10 is a fierce attack!  W is really showing his attitude.]W[pj]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[qi]
;C[W saves sentes at Q12, R12, and a cut at O8; R17 tests B's reaction, smart thinking and clever position.]W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[ph];B[nl];W[oc]
;C[B S15 and later S13 are to settle B's big group.]B[re]
;C[Calm.]W[rc]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[rh];B[qh]
;C[Several W moves here perpare for coming O16.]W[qg]
;B[sg];W[nd];B[nc];W[md]
;C[B certainly wants to play M16, but W can cut at M17 since, if B M18, W has T12 and S16, then B R15 and W P15 is sente to prevent B's ladder.  After B S11, W L17.  B fails.  So M17 is a move when no other choice.]B[lc]
;C[W thus gets this good point.]W[jc]
;B[jd];W[id]
;C[Should play K15.  W would have to play N14, then B J15, W J17 and B M16; B goes out smoothly this way.]B[ld]

;C[W lives.  Although B also connects, W has started to lead.]B[kf]
;C[W invades with determination.  This is not just courage, but also percise calculations.]W[dg]
;B[df]
;C[W's way to live D13 is very smart.  First C3: it's not to live the corner, but to guarantee a sente at D9.]W[cq]
;B[dq];W[bo];B[cp];W[bp];B[br];W[bq];B[cs];W[di];B[eh];W[ei]
;B[fi];W[dk]
;C[Let's see why W D9 is sente: if B connects at E13 instead of D8, W D8 is sente to save get E8 back.  Then W has F10 \(B F9 three stones are to be cut at this moment\) and B can't kill W.]B[dl]
;W[bh];B[bl];W[dh];B[eg]
;C[W lives in B's territory; great skills!  Note: later if B C13, W B10 is key point to live.  Then, \(B first\) E10, D10, C11, C12, A9, B13, B14, and A13, W lives.]W[bk]

;W[ed]
;C[Beautiful order.]B[hc]
;W[hd];B[fc];W[fd];B[gb];W[gd]
;C[To here, either D17 or J17, B gets one.  So like W's success at teh left, B's invasion is also successful.]B[hb]

;B[bg];W[ci];B[cg];W[bj];B[bd];W[bc]
;C[Good move.]B[bb]
;C[If A17, B can make seki after \(B first\) J12, J11, C18, B15, D18, K12, and K14.  Then W would lose the game.]W[cc]

;C[B D10 should throw in at L11, then W must capture L11.  The variation after that is extremely complicated.  If W is careful, he still wins, but a slight carelessness would cost W the game.  This is B's last chance and he missed it.]B[dj]

;C[White wins.

Overview: At the beginning, B's attack at the lower left was successful, thus B began to lead.  B's mistakes \(#70 and #86\), however, cost him the lead.  W played very well afterwards: #93 and #95's sharp attack, and #99's great thinking put W on the winning track.  Later, during W's invasion to B's left and B's invasion to W's top, both players showed tremendous skills.  A spectacular game indeed.]B[ns]

;B[oe]C[When to play P15 and when to play Q14?  This is rather a difficult question.  Fan's later work showed that if B plays Q14 here, W will be able to get P9 point.  Probably for this reason, B \(Shi\) decided to play P15. \(Nowadays, however, P15 is seldom seen, for most modern playes don't like W to get in the corner with R17.\)]
;W[jc]C[K17 is a key point, nothing wrong with it.  Also, ancient players were never hasty to enter the corner because they preferred to "leave some aji."]
;B[qh]C[Certainly.]
;W[qg]C[Heavy.  Fan \(W\) later said, "Casual." \(Editor: it seems all the "casual" moves in Dang Hu Games were belonged to Fan. :-\) W should play P14, then after B O14, W Q14, good.]
;B[rh]C[Normally B would play Q12 instead.  S12 can be also considered...]
;W[og]
;B[ph]C[...but Q12 now is questionable.  B should play N15, Fan later pointed out, and when W Q12, B S15.]
;W[of]
;B[me]C[Again inappropriate.  Should be at O15.]
;W[qd]C[Two consecutive questionable moves by B, and W now has a great chance.]
;B[qc];W[pe];B[od];W[pc];B[rd];W[qe]
;B[qb]C[Lives the corner.  No other choice -- if B S16 played at P17, the loss of corner would be too big.]

;W[rf];B[rb];W[ng];B[ke]
;W[ni]C[W indeed catches B's mistakes, and with a series of good moves, W team comes out.  Meanwhile, B has unsettled teams on each side.  W has undoubtly taken the upper hand.]
;C[B might be also thinking L17: after W L16, B K16.  Now B wishes W to play L18 but W would in fact counterattack at K15.]B[nk]
;W[mk]
;C[O8 would be B's move under normal circumstance.  Here B tries very hard to turn it around, but O10 is somewhat awkward.]B[nj]
;W[mj];B[mi]
;C[Facing B's challenge, W's replies are appropriate.]W[lg]
;B[li];W[oi];B[nl];W[jg];B[jf];W[ml];B[nm]
;C[Urgent.  K16 prevents B L17.]W[jd]
;B[ig];W[jh];B[hf]
;C[W captures B two stones, and B's challenge has failed.]W[kj]
;C[Key point.  It connects B team at right, and at the same time, it extends B's moyo at the left.]B[ef]
;C[W E9 would be a move that will take away a target to attack from B, thus making it difficult for B to win.  But such an "unhurried" move doesn't seem to fit their "taste." Now S9 attacks; sharp.]W[rk]
;C[No way for B to give in here.  Otherwise the whole B right team would be "floating."]B[rl]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[rn];B[rj];W[pk];B[qj]
;C[W strengthens his lower right corner, and B four stones are cut down.  W's fighting beginning with S9 is fruitful.]W[qn]
;C[B hopes to build a huge territory at the left by attacking W F3 stone.  Only way for B to win.]B[eq]
;C[F4 would be simpler -- after B E6 and W J3, when B E9 to attack W D9 stone, W has N3 and W's moyo at the bottom looks even bigger than B's moyo at the left.]W[fr]
;C[Now B gets this key point \(H3\).  Although W is still better, but it has become complicated.]B[hq]
;W[fo];B[en];W[er];B[dr]
;C[W E2 and C2 to leave some aji at the corner, then F6; good order.]W[cr]
;B[ds];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[gl]
;C[B F7 and G9 try to fence a territory as big as possible.]B[gk]
;W[fk];B[dm];W[do];B[eo]
;C[W D5 is a technique.  After B E5, then F4.  This way, W leaves a good chance to live the corner.]W[fp]
;B[hk];W[il]
;C[Leaving the bottom B stones in danger, B is showing his determination to win by struggle.]B[hi]
;C[Very big.]W[mq]
;C[It's actually not difficult for B to live here.  For example, B J5, W J7, and B M5 will probably do it \(especially when lower right W corner is not solid\).  However B doesn't what to lose sente to W, who in turn might do some damage at lower left corner.]B[mp]
;W[np]
;C[B just tries to create a complicated fight which might help him to win.]B[kl]
;C[Good move -- "one stone hits two birds."  On one hand it prevents B H8 cut, on the other hand it continues to threaten bottom B stones.]W[jn]
;C[If M10, W N5 and it would be hard for B to settle both top and bottom.]B[hl]
;W[hm]
;C[Tries to settle the bottom team.]B[ho]
;C[Common play against H5.  W is waiting for B H4, then W H6...]W[ip]
;B[io];W[jo]
;C[...but B applies strong counterattack.  And now W can't play J3, but has to play H6.  In other words, W J4 didn't work and should be skipped -- W should have played H6 directly.  J4 almost cost W the game.]B[jp]
;W[hn];B[ko];W[kn]
;C[Now B has a good shape.]B[mo]
;W[cp]
;C[After this W C4 and B E4 exchange, W's next move is very difficult.  W O3 seems to be the correct move, but after B M6, W M7 and B N7, B gets either M10 or J6.  Another choice for W is M5, but B woudl then cut at O3.]B[ep]
;C[W finally decides to abandon all the other variations \(Editor: unfortunately I didn't include all of them here\) and plays N6.]W[mn]
;C[Sharp and powerful, catching B's weakness in time.  A normal feeling for B here is to play O5 instead, but O5 wouldn't do any good for B here.]B[ln]
;W[lm];B[lo];W[no];B[mm];W[kp];B[lp];W[lq];B[nn];W[jq];B[kp]
;W[kr]
;C[To here every move seems certain.  Although W makes an ugly shape out of B stones, his own stones have weakness everywhere.]B[mn]
;W[ik];B[ij]
;C[Prevents B J6; no choice.]W[hp]
;C[Too greedy!  B doesn't want W to settle cleanly with just one move \(H4\), but B M10 would be as big as K2.  And W's only move against M10 would be K2.  Then B has K7 and L7, and K10 is yet another sente \(W has to play Q10\).  This way, W would be winning.]B[jr]
;W[cq];B[dq]
;C[W lives the corner in sente.]W[bo]
;B[bl];W[jj]
;C[Since W F10 is sente, B has to play J12.]B[ih]
;C[W thus fixed his weakness.  B K2 probably cost him the only chance to win.  Worst yet, B hasn't got sente.]W[lj]
;B[gp]
;W[in]C[W could have skipped this move to play somewhere else, but he doesn't want B to get 2 points here in sente -- not giving up even inches.]
;B[po];W[op]
;B[or]C[B Q5 and P2 try hard to get sente.  Now, for example, if W plays Q2 next, B can play another place right away since B O6 group can live.  If W plays O2 next, after B R5 and W R4, B can again skip a move here since B has a way to connect with S7 stones.]
;W[sm]C[W believes B would have to play T9 here.  After than, whenever B skips a move, W can kill B O6 group.  However B can in fact skip T9 since B has \(after W T8\) P10 and Q11 sente to live right group.  Fortunately for W, this miscalculation will not hurt him.]
;B[qq]C[Seems incomprehensible.  Normally should cut at O3, but W O2 would be a good move, and B still doesn't get the sente.  Now R3 is hoping W to play R4, then B O3 would get the sente.]
;W[nr]C[But W has a strong move in O2.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[pq];W[on];B[oq];W[nq]
;B[iq]C[To here, B paid about 10 points \(losing Q5 and yielding T7 to W\) at the right to get a corner that is yet clean \(W still has S2\).  More importantly, B is still gote.  So the conclusion \(by Chen 9p\) is that B failed in this fight at lower right quadrant.

\(Editor: This fight from W #93 to B #150 is the most complex and most difficult fight in all Dang Hu Games.  When Chen 9p made the above conclusion, he was not very confident.  "Save for later people to study further," he also said.\)]
;C[With this sente, W starts actions toward B's "headquarter" -- B's left moyo.]W[ie]
;B[if];W[fj];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[gi];B[hj]
;C[W's long waited move.]W[ff]
;C[Only move.  B can't play F15.]B[fg]
;C[Good move.]W[gg]
;C[No choice.  If B F15 instead, after \(W first\) G14, G15, E13, F12, G12, E15, and D12, W has two eyes for sure.]B[gf]
;W[fe];B[eg];W[gh]
;C[B again has no choice.  If B G16 instead, W has G15.  B might eventually get the corner, but his big team \(J14\) would be in danger due to lack of liberties.]B[hd]
;W[gd];B[he]
;C[Good timing test.  If B answers with B12, W can either live inside with sente or create numerous ko threats -- thus guarantees the living of W lower left corner -- plus, W T8 would kill B right.]W[ch]
;B[ei]
;C[Good move.]W[eh]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[cj];W[dj];B[dh];W[di]
;C[W's E12 shortened B's liberties, and B has to play E16 here.]B[ed]
;C[W thus easily gets to play G17.]W[gc]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[bk]
;C[W is now clearly winning.]W[hc]
;B[ee];W[ec];B[id];W[je];B[kf];W[ic];B[bg];W[ah];B[dc]
;C[If W plays D9 instead, then it's a seki between W D9 group and B J14 group.  Now W T8 kills B right, which has about the same value \(as seki\).]W[sl]

;W[kc];B[ic];W[gc];B[qh];W[oh];B[rd];W[re]
;C[Apparently, both sides think that P9 is important.]B[ok]
;C[Powerful.  It covers B's corner; at the same time connects with his own stones, thus isolating B J17 stone.  Therefore, looking back, B R12 was questionable.  It should be at N15, and when W P9, B Q11.]W[md]

;W[ld];B[qe];W[rf]

;B[jg];W[ib];B[mj];W[pj];B[pk];W[nj];B[nk]
;C[W Q10 first then O10 and N9 are good moves that take care of both offense and defense.  Without O10 and N9, B could play Q15.  Although W S11 would be a good move in this case, B R11 would force W to play S12 and B would become very thick.  But now with O10, when B R11, W could play R10 cut.]W[mk]

;C[Severe.]B[qq]
;C[Normally, facing a strong potential that B has now, W Q3 would play R4 \(followed by, B first, Q3, P4, P3, and P6\) to try to live.  But one, this \(R4 etc.\) probably wouldn't fit the ancient style; two, W must not be optimistic about his game, so he decides to risk and cut B apart.]W[pq]

;C[Can B N5 \(instead of K4\) to cut? The variation here is extremely complicated \(Editor: sorry I am skipping these variations again *giggle*\) and the result is not in favor of B.]B[jp]
;W[jn]
;C[Again it's not a good time for B to play N5.]B[in]
;W[im]
;C[L6 here seems to be a better move for B.  B H6 intends to give the whole W group an attack, but it's not as tight as L6 would be.]B[hn]
;C[W finally gets a break.]W[lm]
;C[Sharp, but a little bit late.]B[mn]
;W[om];B[rm];W[mm];B[nn];W[nm];B[km];W[rq];B[rp]
;C[Only way to prevent a B cut after B L7.]W[kl]
;B[jl];W[jm]
;C[Seems to be a miscalculation by B.  But in fact it's a hard-thought, deep move.  L6 deprives a possible eye at L5 for W, and it also prevents W from skipping a move here to play D2.  However, W now has M2, but that won't deny the fact that a move at L6 first is better than B M8 directly.]B[kn]
;W[ko];B[ll];W[ln];B[gm];W[hp];B[io];W[lr]
;C[Absolutely.  If M3, W K3 is good order, and B wouldn't be able to attack bottom W team.]B[kr]
;W[lq];B[ls]
;C[Good.]W[mr]
;C[If B plays O2 instead, W L4 is sente.  Then when B K3, W N1 to get three B stones.  Or, when W L4 cut, B plays N1 instead, then W K3 to cut down B group and kill it.

Now B turn to play E2 to attack W team.  This is probably the last fight for B; that is, if W lives here, B's territory won't be enough.]B[er]
;W[fn]
;C[Prevents W D3.]B[ep]
;W[fp]
;C[Necessary.  If B E8 directly, W can live.]B[go]
;W[fo];B[el]
;C[Seems to be incomprehensible.  Normally W D6, but then B B5 is a good move and W can't escape.  After thoughout study, W C5 is found to be an most extraordinary move.  With this move, W team is out of danger.]W[co]
;C[B certainly wants to play D6, but after \(W first\) D5, E5, E6, C4, D7 and C6, W has F8.]B[cp]
;W[do];B[bo];W[bn]
;C[Neither E5 nor C6 here would work for B.]B[bp]
;W[cn];B[bm];W[dm];B[dl];W[fr];B[eo];W[fm];B[fl];W[dn]
;C[No choice.  If B tries to damage W's eyeshape here, W plays D2 and B later might have to live the corner with a ko -- and W would then have no problem to live by playing this ko.]B[dr]
;C[Good move.  Aiming a cut at G8, also prepares a way home.]W[il]
;B[hm];W[jq];B[kp]
;C[K3 and K2 are the only way to live.]W[jr]

;W[gn];B[ho];W[ir];B[mp];W[ik];B[oj];W[gk];B[gl];W[hi];B[gi]

Overview: Both sides had questionable moves, but there were quite a few good moves as well.  For example, W #51, #53, and B #74 etc.  Especially W #131!  If I \(Chen 9p, not the editor :-\) can learn just this move, I would be greatly satisfied.]

;W[ch]C[To here, it's a typical ancient openning.]
;B[ef];W[fe];B[ff]
;W[ce]C[The order of W F15 and C15 doesn't look right; W C15 *then* F15 seems to be the correct order.  Now B can play B15 then D15, and later when B G15, W F16, B J14, and W L17 is isolated.  Had W played C15 first \(without W F15 and B F14 yet\), when B B15 and W B16, B would have to play B14 instead of a possible D15.]
;B[bf]C[But B playes B14 here.  In other words, both players didn't think that there is anything wrong with the order of W F15 then C15.  Later, however, they changed their mind and started to adopt the "correct order" of W C15 then F15.]
;W[gf];B[gg]
;C[Thin.  H15 would be thick.  Now B has ways to invade W corner.]W[hf]
;B[be];W[bd];B[bc];W[ad];B[hg]
;C[Too strong.  W tries to emphasize F13 cut here, but W has weakness in his own stones.  Fan, playing W, abandoned this move in his later works.]W[ig]
;C[B counterattacks immediately.]B[if]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[ge];B[ed];W[ee]
;C[B E16 and D14, good.  Not only repair B's holes, but also leave stones at W's corner.]B[df]
;C[It seems that W should play E17 to take care of one B stone, but to let B play K15 is unbearable.]W[je]
;B[de]
;C[No choice.  W can't give in a bit \(like to play D17\) here since B J14, J15 and J17 three stones are not completely captured.]W[cd]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[ec];W[db];B[eb];W[dc]
;C[If B plays D19 now, it would be no good.  Without G18 first, when B D19, W would have G18 later.]B[gb]
;C[Only move.  If H16 first, B simply J16.  Then when W H18, B F17 is good.  Thus B would create a ko, and W wouldn't have any ko threats while B has at least one in J12.]W[hb]
;C[Good timing.  Normally, W will have to get B19 now to live, but in this shape, B would have G16.]B[da]
;C[So W has no choice but atari.]PL[W]W[ca]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[fc];W[id]
;C[Thus B gets a great move in B19 after H17 and F17.  Without D19, this sequence might work too, but the result wouldn't be the best.]B[ba]
;C[No choice.  If E19 instead, B can play G16 first, then C18, and W corner is killed.]W[cb]
;B[gd];W[he];B[bb];W[ea]
;C[Key.  If atari at F19, W A18 and it becomes a seki.]B[ac]
;W[fa];B[ae];W[ab];B[ib];W[fd];B[fb]
;C[Mistake.  Should play G17.  Althought B can create a ko no matter W plays G17 or K18, but with W G17, it would be a more difficult ko for B to win \(or an easier ko for W to win\).  Now with K18, W gives the ko advantage to B.  W K18 is a casual move.]W[jb]
;C[B gets an advantageous ko in hand, so B is clearly successful here.  However, W corner is not completely dead yet, plus B's upper right corner is still thin.  Therefore, it's still too early to judege that B's situation is optimistic.]B[ga]
;C[W could also consider R17.  But that way, after exchanges at the corner, W wouldn't be able to take the advantage of W's thickness at the left.  Now W P14, hoping to attack B R9 by threatening B's upper right corner.]W[of]
;C[B's corner was already thin before W P14, so B should strengthen his corner here, it seems.  B R12 is rather unexpected, showing a great deal of toughness -- also showing his confidence to live the corner.  Indeed, W's invasion into the corner right now wouldn't be effective.]B[qh]
;W[oq];B[np]
;C[So W decides to give B R9 and R12 two stones some indirect pressure by strengthening his lower right.  If W can generate plenty of ko threats during the process, he can hope to gain by playing a ko with B at upper left.]W[on]
;B[rd];W[re]
;C[B S16 was sente, and B is able to play P12.  Thus W loses apparent attacking targets.]B[oh]
;W[rc];B[qc];W[sd];B[qd]
;C[Since it's hard for W to continue to attack, W G17 is to test B's response.]W[gc]
;B[da];W[ea];B[gd];W[rb];B[qb];W[gc]
;C[B H19 would be steady and solid. O15 is to use offense as a defense, quite severe.  However it's very risky since now W can make the upper left a tight ko at anytime, and if B is to lose this ko, eh's lose territory worth nearly 60 points.  Why so risky? Apparently B isn't optimistic about the situation.]B[ne]
;W[nf];B[mf]
;C[A cool move to prevent a B cut at Q14.]W[pg]
;B[le];W[ph];B[pi];W[oi];B[qi];W[ni];B[gd];W[md];B[ld];W[gc]
;B[mg];W[rg];B[ok]
;C[Both sides struggle for the ko.  To here, W thinks it's time to make it a tight ko.]W[ia]
;B[ha];W[ja];B[gd];W[nc];B[nd];W[gc]
;C[Should look for a ko threat at J14 instead.]B[nh]
;C[Great move.  Obviously, W had foreseen this move when he played Q13 \(#91\).]W[mh]
;C[No choice.  If N11 atari, W can ignore it and finish the ko -- when B R13, W has P15 then R15 to live.]B[ng]
;C[W could also consider G16 connect to finish the ko -- although that means to give up the upper right corner, W would gain sente to play G11 key point to attack.]W[ra]
;B[gd];W[lh];B[rh];W[sg];B[fa];W[mb];B[lc];W[oc];B[pe];W[qg]
;B[lb];W[nb];B[kb];W[gc];B[da];W[qa];B[pb]
;C[To here W damages B's eyeshape with some clever moves.]W[pa]
;C[Only key point to ensure an eye.]B[lg]
;W[mj];B[kh]
;C[W turns to attack B stones at the right.]W[nl]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[pm];W[pn];B[ql];W[qn]
;C[To here B lives at the right, and the fight here comes to a pause.  B captures upper left, thus leads in territory.  But W has also gained: 1. Lower right; 2. Weakened three B stones at the bottom; 3. Upper right B team is not completely alive; 4. Upper left W team is not completely dead, providing numerous ko threats.]B[oj]
;W[cn]
;C[Not too good.  Normally against this type of "3-6 invasion" \(C6\), B should play C5.]B[dn]
;W[co];B[dm];W[do];B[eo];W[bm]
;C[Seems to be the absolute move, but it's in fact questionable here.  B could try B8 to isolate W C9 and C12 two stones.  That way, who's leading would be unclear.]B[eq]
;W[fp];B[ep]
;C[To here, W has greatly strengthened his two stones at the left, while B's corner is almost gone.  W is successful at this corner.]W[bo]
;B[mk]
;C[W tries to save five stones.  Wrong decision.  Should play C3 to get the corner and thus deprive the "root" from lower left B team.]W[lj]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[ji];W[jg];B[nj];W[mi]
;C[These B moves are tight and strong.]B[kk]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[ml];B[kj];W[nk]
;C[To here, although W manages to save a few stones, B's middle is considerably thickened, thus the lower left weak B team gets a big help.  Moreover, the upper left "store of ko threats" for W has lost its value \(later when B takes D16 stones, W will have to play L15 to make an eye\), and B has P7 to threaten a cut.  B has turned it around to take the lead.]B[kg]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[jq];B[om];W[nn];B[kp];W[jo]
;C[Nice.  Make it difficult for W to attack.]B[kn]
;C[And W has to strengthen his own group; no choice.]W[er]
;B[dr];W[fr]
;C[If B plays C4 to live the corner, it would be enough for him.  Now B O7 attempts to "win it faster."]B[nm]
;C[If connect at N7 immediately, B has K4 first then N6 cut, and W wouldn't have a good answer to it.]W[fn]
;B[fo];W[go]
;C[B F5 and G6 are too strong.  Should calmly connect at E6.]B[gn]
;W[fm];B[ho];W[gp];B[en]
;C[B now has to live inside.  Quite a loss by B.]W[el]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bq]
;C[W C2 is to force B to make B A4 and W B8 exchange, thus to strengthen W's outside.]W[cr]
;C[Extremely good timing.]B[fl]
;C[No choice.  If atari at G7, B has B2 to get more liberties at the corner first, then B D9.  At that time, B E7 cut would be severe.]W[em]
;B[ap];W[bl];B[ds];W[cs];B[bs];W[br]
;C[Ko to live for B.]B[ar]
;W[as];B[ao];W[bn];B[bs];W[mm]

;W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[jk];W[in];B[jl];W[mn];B[or];W[pr];B[nr]
;C[W gains at lower left.  B's loss here is due to a couple of too strong moves by him earlier.]W[hl]
;B[hi];W[kr];B[lr]
;C[W is not careful.  Very likely another casual move by W \(Fan\).  W thinks that this will be a "worry-free" ko for him, but in fact he's short on ko threats.  W should play K2, and when later get the sente, W can play F9.  This way, it would be very close.]W[ls]

;C[Another 2-point loss by W.]W[sj]
;B[sl];W[kr]
;C[B decides to give in.  On surface W wins the ko, but the ko is worth only less than a point, while W has lost 4 plus points during the process.]B[ms]

;C[B wins by 2.5 zi \(5 points\).

Overview: In this game, the variations at upper left, upper right, and lower left three corners were interesting and spectacular.  A remarkable fact was that even W seemed to lose at the upper left, from a global point of view, W wasn't exactly lagging.  In other words, Fan and Shi had the ability to control the global situation over local details.  They once again lived up
with the title of "Great National Hands."]W[kf]

 Black wins by resignation

 23 Jun 1992

 Commenaries by TS and
 Olli Lounela, 3 dan.]AB[pd][dp]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[nc];B[jd];W[qf];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[og]C[OL: At 'a' is another possibility.]L[pg]
;W[cn];B[dj]
;W[gc]C[OL: 'a' is probably better.]L[hc]
;C[I felt 'a' would completely waste 
the Black wall to the right.

OL: Not so. A wall is not to be used for making territory in front of it but 
for attacking. 'a' would seem to be better.]L[ec]B[ic]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ec]
;B[cb]C[OL: This seems risky; black leaves all kinds of possibilities for 
white.

Consider, for example, a white invasion at 'a'. Also, there is a very real 
possibility white may be able to cut at 'b' although it is not possible 
immediately.

I would prefer to play 'b'. The actual descent leaves all too much bad aji in 
a position which is supposed to be solid enough to mount an attack.]L[ch][cd]
;L[gf]C[OL: This ogeima \(large horse's jump\) is loose. 'a' would seem 
better.]W[hf]
;B[jf]
;L[hh][jh][ke][nf]M[cb]C[OL: This is a difficult point. 
White has two aims to achieve: punish black from playing the marked stone, 
and gain access to the center.

As the left side is not difficult to invade, not even if black spends an 
extra move there, I would prefer jumping to center, at 'a', and threaten to 
invade much more severely if black won't defend. 'a' also aims at 'b', 'c' 
and 'd'.]W[df]
;C[I considered \(briefly\) 'a' and 'b', but I didn't think 
they'd lead to anything fruitful. 'b' might actually lead to a one-eyed Black 
group.

OL: Partly true. 'b' definitely does not lead to anything; white has the peep 
of 'c' to aid in connecting.

'a', however, looks interesting. It forces black to answer at 'd', after 
which 'e' and 'f' are approximately miai, and 'f' in particular is difficult 
to handle for white.]L[de][ee][ie][ef][cf][fe]B[ce]
;L[ee][dh]C[OL: This move 
is heavy. It would be much better to play a lighter move, and there are at 
least 'a' and 'b' of which to choose.

Making a group heavy and worse, creating a shape that promises little in the 
way of eyes, is an invitation for black to take advantage by strengthening 
the surrounding groups and taking territory...]W[ed]
;C[...which he promptly 
does.

Note that white's group is still weak and in need of reinforcement.]B[cf]
;L[ff]C[Something of a surprise - to me. This, naturally, doesn't mean it's 
bad...

OL: Well, I have my doubts. I wouldn't call this bad, but it certainly has 
the feeling of inadequacy. I think it gives black too many opportunities.

Consider 'a', for example. It's definitely sente and just about shuts black 
in. Furthermore, it makes a promisingly large moyo for black -- if black gets 
a wall facing up at the bottom left.]W[cq]
;C[OL: Good.]B[cp]
;M[cp][cq]W[di]C[OL: This is an emergency measure -- but that does not make it good.

First, there is no way white can afford to give black the moyo resulting with 
'a', 'b' and after black gets a wall, 'c'.

However, if black plays now at 'a', he gets an extremely strong position in 
that corner and lots of profit. White 'd' is small compared to that. 
Furthermore, black's top left corner is rock-solid, and so white will 
probably get attacked on the side.

Whatever happens, if white exchanges the marked stones, continuing with 'a' 
cannot be omitted.]L[dq][ep][ff][cj]
;L[fj][hj][fp][hp][dq][ff]C[Aims at 
attacking C6.

OL: This is bad and wastes the opportunity.

First, lets imagine the normal result after this descent: black gets walls 
around 'a' to 'd'. This is about 40 points territory.

If instead we imagine black 'e', and after white defends his left side \(and 
perhaps some other moves\), a black splitting attack at 'f'. This is *very* 
tough on white; even if he rescues both his groups he gets no territory. 
Furthermore, black is very likely to gain some more during the attack.

I call black's descent a big mistaek.]B[cj]
;W[de]
;B[cd]C[OL: 'a' is probably 
better.]L[cg]
;W[en]C[OL: Again, this should be at 'a'.]L[dq]
;B[dm]C[OL: Yet 
again, 'a' is better.

This time there is no excuse for not playing 'a'. The peep is a small move: 
if black succeeds in cutting at 'b', the territory, instead of the earlier 40 
points, will be only 20 points.]L[dq][dn]
;W[dn]C[OL: This is small. White 
should play either 'a' \(preferably\) or 'b'. Connecting only creates yet 
another weak and heavy group -- which will be a target for black's 
attacking.]L[dq][em]
;B[dq]C[OL: Finally black plays the biggest move on the 
board.

It is clear now that white's game will be at least extremely difficult, if 
not impossible to win.]
;W[ci]
;B[fl]C[OL: 'a' is better shape.]L[fj]
;W[gn]
;B[fo]C[OL: I would prefer a double hane 'a', 'b' and 'c' to settle and 
reinforce the black group. That would let black attack the lonely white group 
much more forcefully.]L[ei][eh][fh]
;W[em]
;C[Afterwards I thought 'a' would be 
better.. if then White D8, Black 'b', W 'c' and W 'd', and White is eyeless 
\(though he is in the open\).

OL: Yes, it does look like the actual move lets white out of the hook. 'a' 
seems a bit better, though I'd say the mistaek has already happened.]L[el][cl][cm][bl]B[dl]
;W[el];B[ek];W[fk]
;C[I was going to play 'a', but 
fortunately I switched to this point, which I think is better.

OL: And still not very good.]L[fj]B[ei]
;W[fj];B[ej];W[eh]
;B[dh]C[OL: I would 
prefer to hane at 'a'. If white cuts, black gets that much more profit, and 
if he does not, black can still continue the attack with 'b'.

Also, if white captures the cutting stone, his group above is impervous to 
any attack.]L[fh][gk]
;W[fi];B[ch];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[bg];W[eg]
;C[Black gets 
over 25 points of territory, but I was a bit unhappy with the secureness and 
strength of White's position.

OL: No kidding. I have the feeling that you should be more than just "a bit" 
unhappy, what with all the wasted opportunities. White has all but evened out 
the game.

BTW, it would be better to put the four marked stones into atari, at 'a'.]B[cg]L[ah]
;W[ke];B[je]
;L[of][qh][pb][ob][qb][oc][rf]C[OL: This is higly 
dubious.

If black connects at 'a', 'b' will be absolutely sente. This makes any escape 
attempt that much more difficult, and dangerous \(black 'b' forces 'c' to 
'g'\).]W[nf]
;L[qg][qh]C[I thought for a long time if I could connect the two 
Black groups with some other move, but couldn't find any... so I decided to 
be an idiot.

OL: If you say so :-\)

Trying to be clever and playing 'a' is no good. It just lets 'b' go to waste, 
and besides, strengthens white's corner more than it strendthens black. It 
would be a typical aji-keshi \(waste of potential\).]B[of]
;C[This attempts to 
live, but I thought it was bad for White. Shouldn't he jump out and split 
Black up?

OL: White has again made the coice very difficult for himself.

Besides the corner group being in need of an immediate reinforcement at 'a', 
jumping out is difficult and dangerous. White's only hope is to pretend he's 
attacking the middle top, but this can work only if black goes ahead and 
believes it...]W[lc]L[qg]
;L[me]C[OL: 'a' seems to be the vital point of the 
shape here.]B[lg]
;W[lf];B[mg];W[kg];B[kf];W[mf]
;L[md]C[OL: This is also 
highly dubious. The vital point of the shape is 'a'.]B[ng]
;W[kd]
;L[md]C[OL: 
Still 'a'.]B[jh]
;L[qh][qg]C[Wouldn't living \(absolutely\) be better?

OL: It does not seem possible as long as 'a' exists.

White's ogeima is no good. It leaves too many weaknesses behind. White should 
play at 'b'.]W[pi]
;B[ob];W[jb];B[ib];W[nb]
;L[kb]C[OL: 'a' instead is better.]B[qb]
;M[qb][pi]C[I would think something like 'a' would be better.

OL: No more. Once black has played the marked stone, the corner is not big 
any more. Besides, if black plays 'b' and later captures the corner, the 
marked white stone will turn out to be in a good place.]L[qh][qg]W[jc]
;L[nj]C[OL: This is much too small. Jumping to 'a' seems called for.]B[hd]
;L[hp]C[OL: I would prefer to play in larger scale, at 'a'.]W[jp]
;B[qg]
;L[qn]C[OL: 
This is bad. It's much too early to try to achieve anything with this group. 
If black wants to spend moves capturing it, that should be fine with white.

'a' is better.]W[rb]
;L[md][lb][la][kb]C[This move puts the White top middle 
group in danger, I believe.

OL: In what way does this change the situation?

'a' \(answered with 'b'\), 'b' \(answered with 'd'\) and 'c' \(answered with 
'b'\) do not seem to work. I cannot see how the white group could be killed.]B[ra]
;C[OL: This is a very bad exchange.]W[rg]
;B[qh]
;C[OL: This is dangerous, 
and looks like it might put the group on the other side in jeopardy.]W[pe]
;B[nd]C[OL: This seems to enable killing of the group to the left with 'a'. 
For example, 'b', which looks like white's best try, gets thwarted in the 
sequence to 'g'.]L[md][lb][ja][ka][kc][kb][ld]
;L[rh]C[
 peter 4d  b shoul play S12 in stead of R12

OL: This is very true. If black now plays 'a' \(S12\), it is sente besides 
sealing white in and completing black's wall.]W[rd]
;C[
 peter 4d  b should capture S18

OL: Not necessarily. I also would prefer making white live \(if he can :-\) 
that small.]B[rh]
;W[se];B[rf];W[sg]
;C[
 peter 4d  a ko..
 giovax 7k  around S18?
 peter 4d  yeah
 peter 4d  b is good with this ko

TS: Maybe, but I thought I'd keep it in reserve.

OL: H'mmm... I feel this is dubious anyway. If you can't kill the center top 
group outright, it's better to start the ko and use center top as a source of 
threats.]B[pm]
;W[pl];B[om];W[mj]
;C[Actually, this appears not to be 
necessary..

Commentary by OL.]
;W[qp];B[oq];W[lp];B[on];W[qm];B[ip];W[mn];B[qq];W[rq];B[pp]
;L[qo]C[This would seem to be a kind of a trick move. Joseki \(according to Ishida's Dictionary\) is a.]W[qr]
;L[pr]C[White's tactics succeed. Black is confused by the atari and his reflexes don't work.

The only move here is the ko shape at a instead of the \(almost useless\) one point jump.]B[ol]
;W[pq]
;C[Black tries to keep the price of his mistaek as low as possible.]B[pr]
;W[po];B[qq];W[oo]
;C[The only move, whatever else happens. There is no way black can afford to play a ko here.]B[pq]
;W[rr]
;L[lq][no]C[This move is a good point and seems to be the only way to salve something out of the situation.

Black is aiming either at a or b, the latter of which seems to connect.]B[mp]
;W[pn];B[lq]
;C[Both the groups in the bottom right corner are safe for the time being. The result is not very satisfactory for black but is not a catastrophe either.

White, however, is very satisfied with cutting black into two and getting sente.]W[pf]
;B[nd];W[fc]
;L[df]C[Black is worried about a possibility of a ladder in the lower right corner. If such a ladder happens, it is better not to give white any free sente moves that might be offered by a.

In a sense black is playing lukewarm, but he definitely does not want any laddery complications in the bottom right.]B[cf]
;W[kc]
;C[Good timing.

Black's idea is not to make a large corner but rather to prevent white from making black live small in the corner and in any way possiblr prevent a white wall, as that would turn the right side into enormous territory in the natural course of things.]B[qf]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[oc]
;C[Natural. Black is not worried about the \(rather small\) corner territory.]B[nc]
;W[nb]
;C[Very big and very important. Black is almost secure.]B[pg]
;W[qh]
;L[ph][of]C[Necessary, and good shape.

At a instead would be asking for trouble since white will most likely be able to extend to b later.

Note how the right side is still open.]B[og]
;W[qc]
;L[qj]C[A light reduction and a good move.

The worst black could do is to invade deeply, say, at a. That would certainly provoke a white splitting attack in which the black group above would suffer and the invading stone would be likely to die.]B[pj]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qj];B[mb];W[ob]
;L[lc][kb][ld][me]C[This move is a compromise.

Black would sorely like to connect at a, but as that would provoke b, it is not advisable, as strenghtening the white stone is as good as giving away points.

Also a move at c or d has similar effect.

Black wants to test white's response with this compromise, and to make the white moyo as small as possible.]B[ic]
;W[od]C[A frightening move. Black seems to be helpless.]
;B[oe]C[The only move.]
;W[mc]C[This cut is a relief for black. The cut at a seems much more serious and much more difficult to answer.

I was really worried about a, as it looks likely it would kill one of the cut black groups, the top or the right side.

However, black might settle to taking the top, and that would be difficult for white. Even with a large white right side, black would seem be ahead in territory and far ahead in thickness.]L[ne]
;C[The only move.]B[ne]
;W[lc];B[db];W[pk]
;L[oj]C[A very good and cool move.

Preventing a white ponnuki on the right side at a is worth much less than securing the black group here beyond question.

Black is doing nicely.]B[kp]
;W[oj]
;L[ni][rd][rf]C[Black goes ahead and takes an enormous point.

This is slightly risky, however, as a white attack at a would be most effective, and it is not clear whether black gets an eye at b after white answers at c.]B[dn]
;L[ni]C[White chooses to start the attack from this side, but attacking at a would be better.

Nevertheless, taking the big corner is understandable, as it is hard to resist a chance of taking territory while attacking.

However, securing the black group by playing at a is more effective than it looks.]W[rd]
;B[ni];W[nj]
;L[mi][mh][mj][lh][lg][mg]C[Execllent. The very best move around here, and the only one that makes white's choice of follow-up a hard one.

First, the sequence of W a, B b, c, d would give black an easy life, and thus be worse than just about anything else.

Other moves are not much better, however. White c is easily refuted by e and f will be answered at e with sad results.

Note, that c is the vital point, and if black gets it he will be perfectly safe.]B[li]
;W[lg]
;B[mj]C[This black move secures an excellent result, with black playing two tenukis and still being far from being in any danger.

Black is clearly leading.]
;W[eb];B[dc]
;W[hd]C[This move is surprisingly effective.]
;C[
 lounela 3d I'm running out of time due to line problems.]B[id]
;W[ie]
;B[gd]C[This move is just about all black can do, as trying to escape at a does not work. Black's group on the right side is not strong enough to stand a concentrated attack if white gets thickness of any kind at the top.]L[je]
;W[hc]C[The only move.

Even if white secures quite a bit of territory at the top, black is satisfied with having secured the top left corner and leaving a bit of aji here.

A typical application of the aji would be to play the kikashi sequence a to f and use that to attack any group invading the left side.]L[gc][gb][he][hb][if][je]
;C[A good and cool move.

With this move black both secures a very large bottom and simplifies the game very much.

Black is getting further and furher ahead and white must be feeling dismayed and desperate.]B[eq]
;W[cl]
;L[bm]C[Good. Since the top left group is rock-solid, black can make this very tight pincer.

Playing on the other side, around a, would be much worse as it would let white steal the whole side without any real trouble.]B[cj]
;L[el]C[This is a surprising move. Even if white needs to take lots of territory to win, letting black strengthen himself further in no way helps.

I would rather play at a, and worry about territory when time comes.

I think white's move leaves black with too easy an answer.]W[co]
;C[The only move. Black is not worried about letting white live in corner, if it happens in gote. The black stone at E3 will serve well in containing any damage.]B[cn]
;W[bn]
;L[bo][cm][cq][cp][bp][cr][br][dr][bs]C[The standard sequence for living in the corner after black B7 is a to i.]B[bm]
;C[This is unexplicable. I would venture a guess it is a typo white did not ask to undo.

Playing the standard sequence \(shown with the previous move\) would guarantee life, but this kaketsugi makes a difference. Now the best white can get is a ko.]W[bp]
;B[an]
;L[ao]C[The ko at a is the only choice. Now white will die.]W[bo]
;B[cm];W[cq];B[dr];W[br]
;L[bs]C[This clearly destrouys white's eyes.

Actually, black a would also work.

The only real difference between this nonworking sequence and the one that would have worked is the black hane at A6.]B[aq]
;C[Since white's bottom right group is dead, white is lost. He needs to do something really effective to get back into the game.]W[mh]
;B[mi];W[mf]
;L[oh][nh][ng][nf]C[This is a slight risk. Black can cut with a to c. Black would have to either give up the tail of the group or play a ko with d.]B[ml]
;W[lo]
;C[Black is taking it easy and playing it safe.]B[kq]
;W[lk];B[mk]
;C[This is bad as it destroys the cut.]W[ng]
;C[Now black only needs to escape or to live to win the game by lots.]B[oh]
;W[jk];B[lm];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn]
;C[Good. Black correctly attaches little importance to attacking and/or territory, and sets to secure the center group.]B[jl]
;W[mq];B[np];W[jn]
;C[Very good. Now the center group is almost perfectly safe.]B[kl]
;W[in]
;C[Black plays one more tenuki and makes the center group absolutely secure.

Black's success in simplifying the game by giving up a few points shows clearly that he knows how the score stands.

The game seems to be irrevocably over.]B[ik]
;W[mr];B[nr]
;L[do]C[This is an interesting move. White sets his aim to destroying the bottom and utilizing the aji left behind by the gap at a.]W[gq]
;C[Black continues playing safe. 

White has about 65 points and black has at the very least 70, and quite a bit of potential for more.

Even if it looks like from the scores that the game is close, this is not the case. White has little potential for more territory and black has lots. Furthermore, every single one of black's groups is absolutely secure. This also is not the case with white's groups.]B[eo]
;W[hp]
;B[iq]C[Good. This takes a few points while threatening white's connection. Also, it leaves no aji behind.]
;W[gn]
;B[ho]C[A mistaek in reading, but not a serious one.

Black could squeeze with a to h, but black would take a few points at the bottom, about 10-15 that is. However, even that would be too much at this stage.

The only other choice is to let black cut. This is very painful.]L[io][go][fo][gp][fp][hq][fn][fq]
;W[go];B[hn];W[hm];B[io];W[gl];B[im]
;W[nm]C[Necessary. Otherwise white cuts with a to c.]L[no][nn][om]
;B[fm];W[gm]
;B[fk]C[Very good. This very clearly seals the victory, for black's left side territory is bound to increase as a side effect of the black attack.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[gj]
;B[fi]C[Black does not need to try for more. He is very satisfied with securing sixth-line territory.

Note that the size of the left side increases with each white push, and black's center group is perfectly safe. Now it pays well to have spent a few moves securing it.]
;W[fr]C[The last attempt of making eyes without giving black any more territory. White tries to make eye shape.]
;B[er]C[Black plays safe, simple and lukewarm. He is aiming at using the aji at a to further the gap.]L[gc]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[gi]
;B[fh]C[Black is happy to push more, as that only increases the side.

The game is over and white has settled the situation beyond any doubt.

White resigns.]

Vol 1" pp 1-94. People's Sports \[China\], 1984]KM[0]C[Go Seigen \(Wu\) vs. Fujisawa

\(The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches\)

Black: Fujisawa Hosai, 9d

White: Go Seigen \(Wu\), 9d

~Date:  January 9-10, 1957

Place: Atami]
;C[This is my first encounter with Fujisawa 9 dan after the 10-game series 4 years ago \[1953; the 3rd Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series\].

Fujisawa 9 dan deliberates on every move; never hasty.  His steady and thick style has well settled in the Go world.

B #1 takamoku \[\(4,5\) point at the corner\] is rarely seen in Fujisawa 9 dan's game.  It's probably a personal inclination intriguered by a recent game of mine.  This will be explained a little bit later.  ]B[pe]
;C[\(* Fujisawa 9 dan's original given name was Kuranosuke, later changed to Hosai.  In his early years, as one of the strongest young players, he was regarded as unbeatable playing Black.  He was also the first player promoted to 9 dan after Honinbo Shusai \[the last Meijin\].  In 1943, as a 6 dan, he played Go Seigen \(then 8 dan\) a 10-game series in which he played all games with Black.  Fujisawa won the series 6-4.  Then in 1951, a 4-game series with Wu \(Wu won all four\).  In 1952, a 6-ga

ies \(Wu 5-1\) and the second Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series \(Wu 7-2-1 with 1 tie\).  Finally in 1953, the third Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series, which ended after Wu led 5-1.
Fujisaw 9 dan's first game after name change was in \[this\] Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches, against Sakata Eio.  Fujisawa played White and adopted a move-imitating strategy, but lost at the end to Sakata.  This game here is the second by Fujisawa after his name change.]W[qp]
;C[B #1 and #3 occupying takamoku points at diagonal corners is the opening Suzuki Etsuo 7 dan used in a game versus me.  Fujisawa 9 dan was then the referee, and he watched the game from the beginning to the end.  That game was won by Black.  Perhaps Fujisawa 9 dan learned some winning strategy from the game, and here he applies the same "diagonal takamoku" opening.]B[do]
;C[W #2 and #4 play komoku \[\(3,4\) point at the corner\], choosing a most common opening strategy.  So far it's exactly the same as the game between Suzuki and me mentioned before.  To resemble kendo \[Japanese fencing\], B raises his sword way above his head, ready to cut down, while W levels his sword, pointing to opponent's throat.]W[cd]
;L[po]C[In the game mentioned before, Suzuki 7 dan suddenly played B #5 at a\[Q5\], an unexpected odd move.  I guess Fujisawa 9 dan probably would not use such a novel move against me.  However it was not impossible, but I was ready.  In fact, even if Ba, there is nothing to be afraid of.

\(* Indeed, B didn't play so \[Ba\], but #5, a common play, instead *\)]B[pc]
;C[W #6 \[D3\] is the normal way against takamoku \[\(4,5\) point\].  Also, allowing B to have shimari \[corner enclosure move\] at both corners would be disadvantageous to W in an opening.  Therefore, #6 is also absolutely the move.]W[dq]
;C[B #7 is a basic joseki.

Fujisawa 9 dan used this move when he played 10-game series with me, and he had used it before that.  Also, he chose this joseki in Mainichi Shimbon sponsored Honinbo Sen.  This is a shape he likes.

If W plays here right away ---

\[*** type 'B' \(CAPITAL B!\) to see variation 1 for W #8.\]

\[*** type 'C' to see variation 2.\]]B[fp]
(
;C[Anyway, if W acts at lower left right away, immediate fights are almost certain to follow \[as the variations show\], so I adopted tenuki \[ignoring lower left\], and turned to upper left.  W #8 shimari \[corner enclosure\].]W[fc]
;B[er]C[B #9 is a joseki move.  This move ---

W #10 \[B5\], a "quick shift" strategy, is also a joseki.  This is a strategy I like.  I have used it many times before; it's a light way to play.]

If this move to play at a\[L17\], it's also big, but #13 gakari is urgent.]L[kc]
;W[lp]L[lq]C[W #14 could also consider to play at a\[M3\].  It's difficult to say which one is better.

If Wa for W #14, it would become a different game.]
;B[on]C[B #15 joseki.

If Ba\[O4\] kosumi, it's also a joseki, and it's a solid way to play.

\[*** type 'B' to see this joseki.\]]L[np]
(
;W[qm]C[W #16 is joseki.

Wa\[P5\] is also a move ---

\[*** type 'B' to see this variation.\]

But as a result \[of this variation\], this part is almost settled, and W should not be satisfied.]L[oo]
(
;M[lp]C[B #17 good point.

\(* Since W M4 \[marked\] is "high" \[at line 4\], B #17 also plays high to squeeze M4 stone. *\)

Besides #17, there are several other big points on the board, but #17 is the most urgent.

Next move W #18 is a difficult point of this opening, it's also a key to decide the outcome of the game.

Under this situation, most common plays \[for W #18\] are ---

\[*** type 'B' to see var. 1\]
\[*** type 'C' to see var. 2\]]B[jp]
(
;C[This move, W #18, is still better off to adopt the plays shown in variations 1 and 2.  W #18 led extremely unfavorable influence \[to W\] later in the game.  This is the intersection point of the opening, and based on the result, this move \[W #18\] is very bad.]W[op]

;L[oo]C[W #20 is the only move, and it's a subsequential move following #18 \[P4\].

Next, how should B #21 respond?  Let's take a look.

\[*** type 'B' to see ref. 1\]
\[*** type 'C' to see ref. 2\]]W[no]
(
;C[Therefore, B #21 \[Q4\] to atari from this side is a good move.]B[pp]
;C[W of course #22 connects.]W[oo]
;C[B #23 is also the only move.]B[po]
;L[nq]C[W #24 can only cut from here.  If W cuts from a\[O3\] ---

\[*** type 'B' to see a short variation.\]]W[pq]
(
;C[If B #25 \[R3\] plays a\[N5\], the ladder wouldn't work, and B would be in serious trouble.]L[mo]B[qq]
;W[pr]
;C[These couple of moves are certain; no variations.]B[qo]
;W[nq]
;L[qk][qi]C[To B #29, it's a settled shape.

Although locally speaking, it looks like a "fair trade." But B #29 has a perfect distance from the shimari at upper right corner.  Counting this, W is at the lower hand.

Next if Wa jumps, Bb is a good point; or if Wb, then Ba is a good point.

In short, this unfavorable result is caused by the "improper taste" of W #18 and #20 \[P4-O5\].]B[pm]
;L[qk][ql]C[W #30 is still better to jump at a\[R9\] \[despite the fact that, pointed out previously, B R11 would be a good point\].

;W[kc]C[If W #36 plays a\[S11\], it would be a good point too.  Then B would get b\[K16\] for sure.  Hard to say which one is better.]L[ri][jd]

;B[cq]C[B of course plays #41.]
;W[ch]C[W #42 too is certainly the move. To let B play a\[C13\] would be unbearable.

;B[hp]
;C[\(Overview; continued\) Since #68 cut, W looked for chances to maneuver over the upper right corner, hoping to settle a team at the right side.  During this complicated conflict, although W achieved the goal to get rid of the trouble, but then #94 was played at wrong direction, thus B #95 started another violent fight. \(To be continued\)]W[eg]
;B[gg];W[br]
;C[\(Overview; continued\) W attempted to counter B's violent attack and rushed with #136.  This move was a serious mistake, led to B's sente attacks -- W fell to being one-sided attacked.  Although W tried to counterattack, but never got the chance. \(To be continued\)]B[pi]
;W[oi];B[nn];W[mo]
;C[\(Overview; continued\) The battle continued to #154, finally making a ko.  This ko was very easy to B, since win or loss \[of this ko\] wouldn't affect B's being leading.  But it was on the other hand a huge, live-or-die ko to W.  With such a difference in lightness and heaviness, B eventually calmly played #155, filling up the holes at upper right corner. \(To be continued\)]B[mr]
;W[ln]
;C[\(Overview; continued\) W #156 was the final struggle.  Because of the improper response of B #157, the nature of the ko changed.  W suddenly saw a hope to turn it around, being obviously down.  Unfortunately, W #162 was less careful, finding a ko threat that was too small.  When B #163 finished the ko, the outcome was then decided. \[End of overview by Wu.\]]B[bh]

\(* From opening to middle game, Fujisawa 9 dan's unique thick and solid style was vividly shown on the board.  He fully exhibited his careful yet sharp character, and using thickness to apply violent attack is Fujisawa 9 dan's specialty.  We can see in this game, facing a strong oppoent, B played calmly, attacked completely, and advanced breathlessly, never giving W much chance.

A possible sequence: White N4, black Q5, W J3.]W[pf]

;C[A very strange shape. The normal way here is first to tsukehiki at White R16, B R17, R15, S17, then defend at R11.]W[ph]

;C[Better to play at L13. This is inducing black to strngthen his moyo. Generally not recommended.]W[lh]
;B[kj]
;C[Too greedy. K13 is better.]W[kf]
;C[This move is dubious.

First, locally better shape would be R5, defending the side better.

Second, the urgent thing on the board is the fight in the top right corner. A cut at K14, K15, K13 seems very attractive. If cutting feels too bold, also a move around K12, threatening the cut, seems good \(and definitely sente besides\).]B[po]
;W[jf]C[Extremely important. Now white is safe and strong here.]
;B[cp];W[dn];B[eq];W[dp];B[dq];W[co];B[cq]
;W[gq]C[Slightly dubious, or craving for beating. White should play solidly anticipating an invasion in the bottom right, say, perhaps around M3. Thus, I would say, F4 is better.]
;B[fp]C[Good. Looks like white were up for trouble.]
;W[gp]C[Very bad style, pushing your opponent in front of you. This definitely is one of the cases where white does *not* want to get attacked.]
;B[fo]
;W[em]C[E6 is better shape on this side, but the urgent thing is to save the two floating stones. I'd try K3, and if black hanes at L3, then crosscut.]
;B[go]C[Black now has a good result here, even though the bottom goup probably could be effectively sacrificed giving white a living group inside black's moyo.]

;W[lr]C[M3 is better.]
;B[mr]
;W[fq]C[White *must* play K3. This is asking for trouble.]
;B[er]C[Good. Besides making black very alive in the corner, this move reduces white's eye space.]
;W[fr];B[hr];W[ir]
;B[gs]C[This seems to be a worng order of moves. If black played first at K2, white would have much worse, only half-an-eye at K2.. The sequence should be K2, K3 \(these reduce white's liberties\), and the go on with G1.]

;W[rh];B[sj];W[ik]
;B[li]C[This is uninteresting. A better way to secure the position would be to play at L8. Note by the way, that black is soon going to play L8 anyway, and this leaves M11 looking small.

If black is worried about the safety of N11 and O11, P11 would be better.]

;B[bi];W[bl]
;C[This is bad. Even if it may feel a bit slow, C12 is the honte. After black played at C12, no move at the top would be a threat. This would help black quite a bit all over the board.

Furthermore, it seems that locally R5 is better than R3. This is because of the bad aji left by Q11.]B[qq]
;C[The right side seems slightly more attractive target for an invasion.]W[lq]
;C[Thick, but a little slack.]B[jq]

;W[np];B[no];W[mp]
;C[Too small and not urgent. Must be around N5 or M6.]B[or]
;W[nq]C[White seems unduly worried about his eye space. Since there were no eye space or shape to speak of to begin with, I would dub this move dubioius.

I would jump immediately to M6 and worry about eyes later.

Jumping to M6 is unattractive, though. Black will strengthen his right side and make it next to impossible to invade. Thus white's reluctance to play M6 is understandable.]
;B[pr]
;W[of]C[This is a bit risky, but white probably feels he's not doing well enough.

M6 would be the honte, but actually the bottom white group is more difficult to attack than it looks. White wants to complicate the game and thus give black opportunities for erring and mistaeking.

I, however, wouldn't hesitate but to play at M6.]
;C[It feels too passive to let white connect and get out.

Probably the correct thing to do here is first pushing at O16, then peeping at Q13 and then either capping \(if it works\) or pushing at N16 \(if it didn't\).

;W[jj]C[The move has the following effects: ladders are usually favorite for
white, it is hard for black to build moyo, and black is hard fight when
jumping into the middle area.  I \(black\) started feeling bad from this
move, because I never won a handicap game starting with tengen \(this
point\).  Jing Yang, a professinal level player, comments "the move is no
big deal and you should think it is far from sides".]
;B[jp];W[cn];B[dn];W[do]
;B[eo]C[C5 is another choice.]
;W[co];B[ep];W[cp];B[cq];W[bq]
;B[dr]C[This is a bad move,
although it does not hurt black
too much.  MGT comments that
the correct move is B2. If
white tries to get the corner,
C7 is a severe move against white.]
;W[cr];B[dq];W[dm];B[en];W[cf];B[fc];W[qn]
;B[ql]C[Q6 is another choice.]
;W[lq]C[A good point to
intrude my moyo.]
;B[nq];W[lo]
;B[jq]C[If black ignores does not play this
move, white can intrude black's
territory at this point.  K6 is
another choice.  But, this move
is recommended when playing
with a stronger player.

Jiang Zhujiu commented that this was not a good move for black to make at this 
time.   He thought black should play at P6, separating the two white groups 
instead, and gain access to the center.]
;W[on]C[This covering is not
firm.]
;B[qp]C[So, Black tolerates now
and seeks some opportunity.  This
move also gets the corner and
will be able to connect R8.]
;W[qi]C[Now, white has to
attack R8 to get some money
back.]
;B[ol]C[Jiang Zhujiu said this was a good move.  He thought black would next 
play at S6 instead, which he does not consider a good move for black.]
;W[nm]
;B[rn]C[This move is a typical
phenomenon of tengen-phobia.
:-\)  Obviously, black should
play at O8 or P11.  Black
should think that the group can
go home at any time he wants.
The ideal sequence should be
B:O8, W:N8, and B:P11.

Jiang Zhujiu thought black should play at P11 instead.]
;W[qf]
;B[nc]C[Again, although this is
not a big mistake, black should
play R15 and then O16 instead.
This is another tengen-phobic
move.  \(Try to settle as soon
as possible.\)]
;W[em]C[This is the key point
for both sides' moyo.]
;B[ch];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[ce]C[C15 can also be at B18,
but then C12 could be attacked.]
;W[bd]
;B[de]C[Black should play the
following sequence: B:B15,
W:D15, B:B14, W:D17, B:E16,
W:C18, B:E14.  Then black can
get an excellent thickness.

Yes, Jiang Zhujiu said black at B15 is the correct play.]
;W[be];B[df];W[dc]
;B[cb]C[Jiang Zhujiu said black should play at D18.]
;W[db]
;B[eb]C[This is a strange move.
E17 is good enough.]
;W[bb];B[ec];W[ca]
;B[jd]C[This point is big.
But, there is a weakness at
D13.  Black should play at D13
or cut at B14.  E12 looks
interesting, but F15 is still a
little annoying to black.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[bf]
;B[fh]C[This is one of the
worst black's moves.  Black
should play F15 to remove its
weakness first.  \(It can also
make the territory of upper
side larger. \) Then, if white
plays at E13, black can play C8
and then C10.  Although, black
groups are separate, it still
looks not as bad.  Since these
moves, black has had less
chance to win.  :-\)

Yes, Jiang Zhujiu said this is not a good move.  Black should play at E13 to 
build a powerful moyo.  \(I-Chen: Well, this is another result of 
tengen-phobia.  I do not think about it even when commenting.)]

C8 first.  White can not
tolerate the cut.]

group a little pressure.  BTW,
I'm not sure if B9 can get
another eye without ko.]

Black should take G15
directly.]
;W[gn]C[Jiang Zhujiu is satisfied with white's game now.]

black's groups, although the
territory will become smaller.
Black should make its left
group alive first.]

grief. ]

and play at J16.]

Comments by JB, TS & Olli Lounela, 3 dan.]B[qd]
;W[dd];B[oc];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]
;L[pl][qk]C[OL: 'a' is more normal. If you want a bit more distance from the kakari stone, 'b' is also possible. The actual move is not often seen.]B[pk]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]
;C[JB: Wasn't too sure of this point, but the 4th line seemed better balanced than the 3rd. 

TS: Then again, 'a' has a continuation at 'b'. More interesting, however, is R3: is that correct?

OL: There's nothing worng with R3. More dubious is R4, but it probably is OK, too. However, white should jump to around 'c' or 'd' instead of the actual move. It may even be that pincering at 'e' is possible as well.]L[qm][rk][no][mp][nq]W[pm]
;C[TS: Maybe something like 'a'?

OL: That depends. I would probably jump to 'b' immediately and let the right side be for awhile.

Note, that if white answered 'b' at 'c', 'd' would separate white into two and white would be hard pressed.]L[ph][mp][qi][oj]B[nk]
;C[JB: If Black is going to build a moyo, I'd better have one, too. 

TS: Usually you try to prevent double-wing formations, but here, I don't know. Black's right side is pretty open.

OL: Yes, I think 'a' is more urgent, as it is the border of the two \(potential\) moyos.]W[dj]L[jd]
;B[jd]
;L[jp]C[JB: Perhaps a reduction of the Black moyo right away would have been better. But I liked the fact that this gives a double extension from the star point, and eyes the 3 black stones in the bottom right. 

TS: True - at this point I thought about trying to sacrifice them.

OL: Actually this extension is not a bad idea. As go is also a game where fighting spirit is very necessary, this move can be understood as saying: "Your moyo will never be big enough to win", and so this kind of move always serves to unnerve the opponent. Also, the white moyo grows quite nicely. 'a' would be more coherent and consistent, though.]W[jq]
;C[TS: Black's moyo is starting to look kinda large.

OL: Which is what could have been said about that of white's after the last move :-\)]B[fc]
;C[JB: Try to make Black over-concentrated with the tsuki-nobi. 

TS: Maybe, but Black can \(could have\) take sente.

OL: Neither is actually the point here.

The point here is that black is trying to secure his moyo any way possible. A tsuke is not to be recommended since it strengthens black. As black's moyo is larger in scale \(extends further into the center\), it is naturally very open for invasions, for example any of the moves from 'a' to 'd'. For this reason a normal move would be 'e', and then invade. 'c' looks most promising.]W[fd]L[hc][ld][oe][qi][df]
;B[gd];W[fe]
;C[JB: Didn't think this was good right away. It is a good spot from the point of view of the two moyos, but gives White a big corner and excellent shape with the next move. 

TS: I should've played 'a'. Then if W 'b', 'c' is *big*.

OL: The actual move is correct. If white takes sente, he leaves weaknesses behind. That is why this is joseki.]L[ec][dc][oe]B[ge]
;C[JB: I was happy with this corner at this point. 

TS: I was unhappy about it.]W[ec]
;C[TS: I didn't see an alternative for this, though.]B[gc]
;C[JB: Now I had to do something to keep the Black moyo from getting too huge. \(And all the books say this is the spot :-\). 

TS: It is.]W[oe]
;C[TS: After the game I thought 'a' might be better. 

JB: I like this move better than "a".

OL: Right. What counts here is the black thickness to the left. The right side is too open, and one could call the top large.]L[pf]B[nd]
;W[qe];B[pd]
;C[JB: Trying to be light. Connecting to make a shapeless line of 3 stones looked very bad indeed. 

TS: I would've liked that. :-\)

OL: This is a reasonable move, but trying to secure eyes here will probably hurt the white group below.

A still lighter approach would seem to be called for, I would probably play around 'a'.]W[qi]L[ng]
;C[JB: This didn't look so good to me. 

TS: No. But what, then? B 'a', W 'b', then.. what?

OL: No, no, no and no. 'a', 'b' is a bad exchange, for sure, but the actual move is little better.

I think that 'c' is best, since is also has some effect on the white group below.]L[qj][pi][rk]B[rj]
;W[qj]C[OL: This is bad style. White is only creating a heavy group. Around 'a' would be better.]L[oh]
;B[qk];W[ri]
;B[rl]C[OL: Good. Besides being good style, this move attacks the group below quite nicely.

One can anticipate problems for the white group above.]
;C[JB: I like my shape a lot better both above and below now. And the Black group looks eyeless and weak.

OL: I call that an illusion. The seqence here was neither necessary nor good for white. White's group above is fairly heavy...]W[rm]
;C[JB: The best point, I think. I was rather expecting it. 

TS: Then again, there's 'a'...

OL: This is a difficult point. There are also ather moves, particularily 'b' and 'c', of which 'b' looks especially attractive.]L[oi][mi][qg]B[oh]
;C[JB: A bit of fighting spirit. I didn't want to just follow orders and live humbly on the side. 

TS: Sure enough, W plays there.]W[oi]
;C[JB: But this was a pretty good reply which I hadn't considered. 

TS: For a change, Black did some reading. 'a' leads to a cut, and so does 'b'.

OL: Yet some more illusions. The three connected stones are not necessary for white's life. ]L[ni][pi]B[oj]
;C[JB: Not quite ready to give in yet, though. 

TS: Well, yes, 'a' would be totally insipid.

OL: Not only that but downright bad. Any and all good moves that white has played would go to waste if white played 'a' and let black seal him in.]L[pi]W[ni]
;C[TS: Of course, Black must cut.]B[pi]
;W[ph];B[pj]
;C[JB: Now I hoped to get in a splitting attack somewhere around A, but never got the chance. :-\(. 

TS: I would've sacrificed \(for the time being, at least\) the three Black stones below and tried to swallow the whole upper side \(talk about greed!\).

OL: First things first: the white group invading the black moyo is just about absolutely secure. That means black is behind since his compensation is not quite par to white's achievement.

But that's not all: the white group below should be able to live all by its own, and black's groups are eyeless and the bigger of them is terribly heavy.

Black has a very difficult game ahead.]L[mn]W[pg]
;C[OL: This is risky. Black is splitting himself...]B[nh]
;W[mi];B[nf]
;C[JB: I considered wedging in at A, but talked myself out of it. I think I should have done that, after all. 

TS: If Black 'b', what has W accomplished? The actual move seems pretty thick.

OL: This is giving up in the middle of a fight. I'd live in there with 'c' to 'e' and at worst have a ko at 'f'. What with white's lots of local threats it is even possible white may get to break out at 'g'.]L[ng][og][rd][rc][rf][sd][ne]W[mh]
;C[JB: A very strong move, I think.

OL: Probably the only move.]B[of]
;C[OL: Now this may be too late...]W[rd]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[rc]
;L[rg]C[OL: 'a' is the vital point, and white would live with it. Also, it looks like black could kill at 'a'.]W[re]
;B[sd]
;C[JB: I didn't think I could live if Black got this point first, so I had to defend and let Black do something with the drifting group below. Shucks.

OL: You should be happy to live after getting the magari of N12.]W[rg]
;B[lk];W[ji]
;L[mp][no]C[TS: Slow? 

JB: Looks like a nice shape to me.

OL: 'a' would be better. Perhaps even 'b' would be possible.]B[nm]
;C[OL: Looks like white will extricate himself while causing trouble to the three black stones below...]W[nn]
;B[mn];W[no];B[ln]
;C[JB: This is the spot I was aiming at with the last two moves.]W[nq]
;C[TS: Black decides to save these stones now anyway, but 'a' might be better. Once W played 'b', the game became difficult.

OL: For saving these stones, 'c' is the correct move.]L[jo][eq][rq]B[nr]
;L[rr]C[JB: But solidifying my moyo was obviously much more important, so I forgot about the bottom right for now.

OL: Playing 'a' first as a kikashi, since black seems to feel like defending the three \(or, four now :-\) stones, would be a good idea. 'a' is very big. Besides, it also affects white's eye shape.]W[eq]
;C[JB: This surprised me. The corner was open at A, so I didn't think I had much in the way of an attack here. 

TS: I was preparing for 'b'. Ha, talk about wishful thinking...]L[rq][hq]B[lq]
;C[JB: But I thought I had better get some eye space for myself right about now.

OL: This point is much bigger than it looks. Getting it makes white's lead crystal clear.

I would call black's forcing white to defend the corner a thank-you move. White's bottom left is secure anyway.]W[rr]
;C[TS: Maybe 'a', now? Or are the Black groups too weak...

OL: It is sad, that black can't secure his groups with 'b' once and for all, since it would be too slow. But the actual black move leaves dangerous weaknesses.]L[hq][mq]B[jo]
;L[ff]C[JB: I thought I had the lead at this point. I gave about 40 secure points to Black for the top, but very little elsewhere. I had perhaps 10 between the two groups on the right and 15-20 in the top left, so it looked like if I got 20 at the bottom, I would be in good shape. 

TS: Right, I was depressed at this point, but somehow got the strength to fight on...

OL: The actual move is very slack and very small. Black can not hope to make any territory at the bottom anyway and white gains little. At 'a' would be biggest. Besides, it would be the finishing point for the unfinished joseki.]W[hp]
;C[TS: I couldn't win by enlarging my moyo anymore, so I had to invade.]B[di]
;W[ej]C[OL: I would play at 'a' and let black escape for several reasons.

First, the left side is all too large to keep it all. One side has to be sacrificed.

Second, descending gives black least help in settling himself.

Third, the top left is secure enough as it is.

And last, the bottom left would be very difficult to invade successfully after the descent.]L[cj]
;B[cj];W[ck]
;L[bj][ci][bl][bi][ak][hn][ch]C[JB: This surprised me a bit...

OL: No wonder. It would surprise me, too.

The black double hane is not very good. A sequence from 'a' to 'e' can be expected, after which the bottom left is absolutely secure \(50 points or more\) and white has a nasty continuation lurking at 'f'.

A more normal \(and very likely MUCH better\) way of playing would be to make a kaketsugi \(hanging connection\) at 'g' and if white 'a', then play ko at 'd'.]B[bk]
;W[bj];B[ci];W[bl];B[bi]
;C[JB: I was more than happy to take a big area at the bottom left.

OL: This is exactly the expected good-for-white result. Now black is heavy; the ko shape would have been much lighter and better.]W[ak]
;B[ce]C[OL: As a result black has to resort to helping white's corner position.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[ei];B[dg]
;C[TS: The game really looks unwinnable now. 

JB: Yes, but never underestimate the ability of your opponent to throw it away :-\(.

OL: As 'a' and 'b' are miai, the top left corner seems safe. The game really does look unwinnable.]W[hn]L[cb][fg]
;C[TS: The aim was not to reduce White's area but to attack the group above.]B[il]
;L[gl]C[JB: I thought that as long as I connected my centre stones, I would be in good shape.. 

TS: Yup, W saw through my attempts. I was getting ready to resign.

OL: The white stones are not exactly in danger yet. I would suggest a more effective tactics: securing the moyo at 'a'. That kind of move really has an unsettling effect on your opponent...]W[hj]
;B[gl];W[fm];B[fl];W[em]
;C[TS: Black is starting to aim at 'a'. 

JB: 'a' didn't even occur to me.

OL: 'a' is hypotetical. As black only needs to connect the center stones in sente to keep the miai possible, the corner is still very secure.]L[bb]B[gj]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[fi]
;C[OL: This cut does not work; the squeeze that follows is good for white.]B[hi]
;W[hh];B[ii];W[ih];B[ij];W[jj];B[hk]
;C[JB: Trying to protect the cutting point A in sente. I thought that the cut at B didn't work, but failed to consider C.

OL: You were partly right.

First, the shape move for the connection is 'd'.

Second, 'c' does not seem to work if black answers at 'e'.]L[gh][jh][kh][fg][kg]W[eg]
;C[TS: 'a' is starting to materialize...]L[bb]B[ef]
;C[JB: Too aggressive. My own corner was weaker than I thought.

OL: Not only that, but it's bad style. You are begging for an upset. When this much in lead, you should play absolutely safe.]W[df]
;B[de]
;C[OL: Uh, oh...]W[dh]
;B[ff];W[cg]
;C[JB: Black protects his own cutting point in sente, and now I start to see the error of my ways. :-\(.]B[gg]
;W[gh]
;C[TS: AAAAAAAAHHHH...]B[bb]
;L[ac][db][cb][ca][dc][cc][eb][da][ab]C[JB: The corner looks like it has had it, so I better salvage what I can on the side. This is a disasterous "exchange". 

TS: W is still ahead, though.

Besides, there's a ko in the corner yet: white plays 'a' and the sequence to 'd' follows.

If black plays 'c' instead of 'b', then W 'f', B 'g', W 'b', B 'h' and the result is still a ko.

Pushing at 'b' instead of 'g' in the latter sequence does not work: W 'g' and if B 'i', white hanes at 'h' and wins the semeai by one liberty.]W[bg]
;C[TS: Aiming at 'a'.]L[kh]B[kf]
;L[ed]C[TS: Something of a surprise...

OL: Right. This move does not even peep, since black has 'a' in reserve.

Note, BTW, that a black throw-in at 'a' also makes the coner ko sequences invalid by taking a liberty from white.]W[hf]
;C[JB: Two mistakes: didn't see this Black move, and thought the peep was enough of a threat that Black had to answer. Had I simply connected, things would have still been close. 

TS: BS - W would have won.]B[kh]
;C[TS: Thanks. n

JB: You're welcome.

OL: This really is a thank-you move. It's better to connect at 'a' immediately. That leaves black with a weaker position, and with the peep, white does not accomplish anything.]W[jg]
;B[kg]
;C[TS: Would W play K13 now?]W[jh]
;C[TS: _Now_ the game is close, I think.]B[lj]
;L[gf][cc][ee]C[OL: Instead of this, I would start the ko in the corner. The cut at 'a' is not serious if black now plays 'b' thus making 'a' and 'c' miai.]W[ed]
;L[ac]C[OL: Dangerous. Black can still start a ko at 'a'.]B[gf]
;C[JB: Trying desperately to get enough liberties to cut at A. Futile.]L[ee]W[fb]
;C[TS: I thought a looooooooooooong time for this one. Other alternatives: 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

OL: Probably 'a' is best since it gives black the most liberties.]L[cc][db][ac]B[cb]
;W[cc];B[db];W[eb];B[ac]
;C[JB: Giving up on the corner.]W[id]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[jc];W[jn];B[jk]
;L[qs]C[OL: There is a kikashi white should play first. 'a' in the corner is bigger than it looks and just about absolute sente.]W[ko]
;B[mp];W[np];B[rs];W[rq]
;L[sm]C[This doesn't work.

OL: Right, 'a' is better and sente besides.]B[rn]
;W[sm];B[qn];W[qm];B[sr]
;L[om]C[JB: Didn't like the prospects if Black got this point...

OL: I would have played 'a' to make eye shape and to enlarge the territory inside. After 'a' there seems to be no way of destroying the eyes.]W[ro]
;B[jr]
;C[JB: A mistake, I think. Cuts Black, but with the last Black stone there, there is no longer any point in cutting. This just lets Black walk into my territory a bit too easily. 

TS: Right. John sure was full of surprises that day... ;-\)]W[mo]
;B[iq];W[kq];B[kr];W[ip];B[hr]
;C[TS: This surprised me.. I thought B might die, and I cursed myself again...]W[mr]
;B[lr];W[mq];B[ms];W[hq];B[ir];W[gr];B[gs];W[fs];B[hs];W[fr]
;C[JB: Black has enough room to live on the edge, which I hadn't counted on.]B[oq]
;W[ps]
;C[Black has one sure eye at JK1 and one at Q1. White is about 15 points behind now. 

White resigns. 

Perhaps this game should be titled:

"How to build up a lead and then
tear it down again."]B[qs]

 Comments by TS, JB and
 Olli Lounela, 3 dan.]
;W[dp];B[pq]
;W[po]L[qk]C[JB: I like to play the high 
kakari here before Black plays around "a".

OL: Moyophobia, eh?]
;B[np]L[pl][qo]C[TS: 'a' might be better, after all. I 
was just tired of seeing it all the time.   

JB: Most people seem to play "b", leading to a similar result to the move 
played.

OL: All three are probably acceptable although the actual move feels a little 
slack, as if black were lazy.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]
;W[qk]C[TS: This, as 
Kajiware puts it, kicks Q16 in the teeth.

OL: That's what he says all right, but even the professionals disagree about 
it... :-\)]
;B[cd]
;W[ed]C[JB: Same idea again.]
;B[df]L[hd][gc]C[TS: I figured 
Q16 had already lost its main power, so I thought getting sente is best.

JB: I would think that playing something like "a" would be better to try to 
keep the star-point stone happy in at least one direction.

OL: Well, this is not a simple matter. Naturally 'a' is worth considering, 
and 'b' is actually modern style.

However, I feel that creating a symmetric position lacks in fighting spirit, 
makes the game too simple.

I'd probably play 'b'.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be]
;W[ic]C[JB: Now the star-point 
does look fairly constricted.

OL: This situation is not to black's liking. The invasion at 'a' is just too 
easy to do, and there are no good moves for black in the top right corner.

Whereas no real mistaeks have been made, still white seems to have taken the 
lead.]L[qc]
;B[on]
;W[oo]L[pn][qm]C[JB: The idea was to make the next move 
\("a"\) sente.

OL: That does not make it a good move. This move just strengthens black.

The normal way is to play 'b' and not strengthen black any more than 
absolutely necessary.]
;B[no];W[pn]
;B[fq]L[nn][pm][qm]C[JB: But Black didn't 
cooperate, leaving the cut at "a" behind in order to play the kakari. \(A 
very good idea, I think.\)

OL: I would be tempted to play the double hane at 'b' immediately, so as to 
test white's responses.

If white answers at 'c', 'b' is a good forcing move, and black can take sente 
elsewhere.]
;W[eq]L[ip][dn]C[TS: This is a bit unusual, I think. 'a' perhaps? 
Or is that asking for trouble?  

JB: This makes Black solid, but perhaps overconcentrated?

OL: White should just play 'b'. Here again white strengthens black more than 
necessary. As a result, black gets a large moyo.

This seems to make the situation even again.]
;B[fp];W[dn]
;B[ip]L[jp]C[JB: I 
think "a" would be a better point. This looks a bit cramped.

OL: I don't agree. Probably Tero put a bit of thought into this and this 
indeed seems better than 'a'.

What is worng with 'a' then? Nothing immediately, but it is a half-measure. 
It does not protect either side completely.

It's better to protect one side and play a bit further away from thickness, 
the wall of black's.

After the actual move, white will find it hard to invade the bottom.]
;W[cj]C[JB: Black's bottom territory is a fairly secure 25 points, but White's 
4 stones have mapped out a moyo of about the same size. \(But it is not 
secure yet, of course.\) White is going for fairly quick development.

OL: A good move. If white does not play here, black will very soon extend to 
'a'.]L[cl]
;B[gm]C[OL: Dubious. Black seems possessed of the idea of 
protecting the bottom territory.

Black should extend to 'a' instead, aiming to invade at 'b'. If white 'c', 
black could extend to 'd' and get something out of the top 
right.]L[kc][gc][ie][qi]
;W[qf]C[OL: Good.]
;B[mc]L[nc][qe][qc]C[JB: I think 
perhaps "a" or "b" would be better. Since thickness here is likely to be 
hampered by the White groups on either side, I would try to get some 
territory instead.

OL: It does seem as if 'a' was better, for now white can invade at 'c' -- and 
should do so immediately.

The likely result is white living in the corner and black getting a wall 
worth nothing.]
;W[nn]C[JB: This seems to be the time to make the cut since 
there is now a pair of moyos adjoining each other.

OL: This seems crude.

If we hypothesize a continuation to 'f', the marked white stone becomes 
misplaced, for it should now be at 'g'.]L[mn][nm][mm][nl][ml][nk][qi]M[qk]
;B[mn]L[om]C[TS: 'a' looks more natural. If black is going to give in, P6 is 
better played at O6.   

JB: I expected "a" followed by a bit of a fight in the centre. I was happy to 
extend on the sixth line.

OL: Giving this atari is natural, since black is not interested of fighting 
inside of what would have been his moyo.

However, black's bottom seems to be growing faster than white's side.]
;W[nm];B[mm]
;W[ml]L[mo][nl][om][ll][mk]C[TS: An overplay?   

JB: Most likely. But the cut at "a" looked like it might come into play, and 
b-c-d-e looked good.

OL: Most surely an overplay.

Black will solidify the bottom and reduce effortlessly the right side as a 
result of the cut at 'b'.

'a' is not very likely to materialize.]
;B[nl]C[TS: I felt this was necessary. 
W's area looks too big if I just hane.]
;W[om];B[nk]
;W[ll]L[mo]C[JB: This 
looks manageable, with "a" lurking in the background.

OL: Manageable, yes, but good, no. White will have to run through dame points 
in the center and black will gain lots.]
;B[km]
;W[lj]C[JB: My idea here was to 
chase the two Black stones a bit and hopefully 1\) Solidify the right side 
and 2\) make a bit more shape for my 3 centre stones.

OL: John seems to have it the worng way over. Black is the one doing the 
attacking.]
;B[ni]L[pj]C[OL: "Forcing" first at 'a' would be a bad idea. White 
would cap at the marked stone and black would be very much in trouble.]M[ni]
;W[pi]
;B[oh]C[OL: I would be willing to try for a more efficient result, the 
combination of 'a' \(white probably answers at 'b'\), 'c'. ]L[pj][qj][ph]
;W[oi]L[nj]C[JB: Aiming at "a", but...]
;B[mh]C[JB: This is a good reply that 
prevents it.

OL: Even so, it feels unimaginative. I feel black could try and push for a 
bit more somehow. Perhaps 'a'.]L[lh]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[ng]
;B[nh]C[OL: Now black 
is heavy and white seems to be ready to turn the tables and start attacking.]
;W[kh];B[lf]
;W[mg]C[OL: This is a bad move. White solidifies black while 
gaining just about nothing. No more attacking for white :-\)]
;B[lg]
;W[lh]C[JB: connects the white stones securely, and will allow the side to be 
solidified, at the cost of two stones. Seems reasonable.

OL: There are no new connections. White would have done better by trying to 
make shape some way, eg. 'a' and leave the marked stone for aji.]L[jj]M[ng]
;B[of];W[pg];B[og]
;W[jl]C[JB: I think this turned out pretty much as I hoped. 
The right side is fairly secure, and the centre group has a manageable shape.

OL: Worng and worng. Even if the centre group is 'manageable', black has 
almost solidified the top right and the bottom. Black's bottom left is 
reducable, and the right side is smaller than it looks.

Black seems to be well ahead.]
;B[jj]C[TS: I felt B hadn't gained anything 
from the attack yet, so that I had to keep the pressure up.   

JB: I expected Black to secure his bottom area. This Black stone looks a 
little lonely.

OL: This is bad and dangerous besides. Defending the bottom is much more 
important.

If black 'a' instead, after black has secures the bottom, the centre group 
has to settle itself *_in_gote_*. This would be good enough to secure the 
game.]
;W[jm]L[kl][kk][jk][kn]C[JB: Push into the bottom, protect against 
a-b-c \(d is a ladder\), and expand the centre group to make it stronger. I 
liked this one. :-\)

OL: This move immediately gives black a reson for regret.]
;B[kn];W[ji];B[ij]
;W[kl]C[JB: Time to connect solidly. If Black pushed through it would be a big 
loss.

OL: White's centre group seems safe enough and black has lost about 10 or 15 
points in allowing white to push with the marked stone in sente.

If anything, white seems to be leading again.]M[jm]
;B[jg]L[jn][jf]C[TS: Maybe 
'a' would have been better.   

JB: The two directions are certainly miai. I intended to jump to "b" if Black 
played "a".

OL: Kind of, but 'a' is certainly more important for black.]
;W[jn]L[mo]C[JB: 
There seem to be a lot of potential uses for "a" now. Black's attack on the 
White stones has reduced the lower territory, which is an undesirable effect.

OL: Which is exactly the reason black should never have let white through 
into the bottom.]
;B[jo]
;L[cl]W[gn]C[JB: "Contact plays for defense."

OL: This is slightly dubious. One only plays this way if nothing else works.

The reason is that if black gets a wall facing left, the invasion at 'a' will 
be severe.]
;B[fn]L[hn]C[TS: 'a' seems more severe, now that I look at it.

OL: Perhaps, but blocking on the outside seems natural in view of the fact 
that black wants a wall facing left here.]
;L[go]C[OL: Dubious. Letting black 
atari at 'a' is just too good.]W[hm]
;C[OL: Good. Black needs to secure the 
bottom to have any chance of winning.]B[go]
;W[hn];B[gl]
;W[io]L[ko][mo][ho][hp][kj]C[JB: I thought that because of the cuts at "a" and 
"b", Black would have to defend there, and then c-d-e would give the White 
group 2 eyes.]
;B[ho]L[jp]C[TS: 'a' is definitely safer, but then H5 
practically lives. 

JB: Yes. This effectively stops the eye, but leaves 'b' undefended.

OL: A fact is that white cannot be stopped from living. This means that 
leaving 'a' is just giving up points. An almost sure way to lose.]
;W[ko];B[in];W[ln];B[mo]
;W[lm]C[JB: So the eye appears elsewhere.]
;B[kj]C[JB: Black takes 
away the  other eye rather than defend the bottom territory. Correct, since 
White can no longer take the time to invade.]
;M[ji][kh][lh][kj][jj][ij]W[ki]L[li][jp][hk]C[JB: Defend "a" and reduce the 
liberties of the 3 black stones.

OL: I would atari at 'b' first, just to test black's responses.

Furthermore, the three marked white stones are not that big. I'd try to 
escape at 'c'. Note, BTW, that black cannot connect with 'a'. This means that 
black also has to be careful after 'c' as there is a chance of the three 
marked black stones coming under attack.]
;L[jp]B[kp]C[JB: Perhaps a bit 
premature. White still can't afford the luxury of a play on the lower side, 
so no need to defend it yet.

OL: Not exactly. The atari at 'a' would be sente and ensure an encroacment of 
the bottom.]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[ig];B[if]
;L[hf][hg][gc]C[OL: White's two last 
moves seem to be in worng order.

Had white pushed first, black would be forced to go along with the tesuji at 
'a'. Now black can atari at 'b' instead, which would make an invasion at 'c' 
severe.]W[hi]
;B[gi]L[hg][gj][hk][ei]C[TS: 'a' seems essential.  

JB: But if Black "a", then b-c-d should get the White group to safety.

OL: The white group in the center is going to be safe no matter what black 
does. 'a' is better.]
;L[hf][hg][gg][ih][hh][gj]C[OL: I would hane at 'a', 
which is a tesuji.

If black cuts at 'b', the sequence to 'e' can be expected, after which black 
connects. After this, the cut at 'f' seems a most efficient way of settling 
the shite group in sente.

This sente would in turn be very useful at the top.]W[gh]
;B[fi]
;W[hg]L[jh][ih][gg]C[TS: White has two eyes now. Not good...  

JB: Safe at last. Black can still play a-b-c but there are lots of ways to 
handle that situation. The top and left look pretty insecure now, though.]
;L[cl]C[OL: Invading at 'a' is more urgent. Black's position there is 
stronger.]B[gc]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[gf]
;M[hf][gc]W[hf]L[fd][gg][jh][hh][jf][kg][ge]C[JB: Probably should have played 
"a" instead. The centre group should still manage. b-c-d-e-f and THEN push 
through, for example.

OL: Too complicated; white should just play 'g', which would make miai of 
living with 'a' and connecting with the marked white stone, even while 
capturing the marked black stone.]
;B[fd]
;L[gb]C[OL: Dubious. As the center 
group is alive, white should just secure life for the one at the top, by 
connecting underneath with 'a'.

The size of the ko that follows means that white has mistaken.]W[fc]
;B[ge];W[gb]
;B[fb]C[JB: This is an enourmous ko.]
;W[gd];B[mk];W[lk];B[gc]
;W[ec]C[JB: 
There are fortunately some local threats.]
;B[hb];W[gd];B[mi];W[li];B[gc]
;C[OL: This kind of move is usually bad.]W[ga]
;B[ha];W[gd]
;B[em]C[JB: This 
seems a bit too mild.

OL: Too small is the word.]
;W[fe];B[cl]
;W[cm]C[JB: I thought I had better 
solidify the lower area, and try to make use of the isolated stone later.]
;B[dl]
;L[rd]W[qc]C[JB: Since I couldn't figure out what to do on the left, I 
decided to take the big point on the right instead.

OL: This is slightly risky. I wouldn't be confident of living in this corner.

I would just play at 'a' and take sente.]
;B[qd];W[pc]
;B[oc]C[OL: I would 
attack at 'a' and go for a kill.]L[ob]
;W[rd]
;B[ob]L[re][rc][qe]C[JB: This 
surprised me. The usual a-b-c would affect the White territory below, and I 
don't think Black can get much on the top edge with the now-strong white 
group there.

OL: Taking sente is correct.]
;W[qe]
;B[pe]L[eh][fg]C[TS: 'a' would leave B 
with reasonable prospects, though it would still be tough.  

JB: I though this was too small. I don't think White could have done anything 
here anyway.

OL: Black wastes sente, for there is nothing white can do here. 'b' instead 
would leave black leading.]
;W[dg]C[JB: This contact play seems a good spot to 
start trying to make use of the cut-off stone. I didn't really expect to live 
so much as to take as big a bite as possible out of the territory.

OL: Well, white still needs to do something to the right side...]
;B[eg]
;W[dh]C[JB: On the other hand....]

OL: This is not so simple. The game seems to hinge on who succeeds here.

Accordingly, I probably would descend to 'b' so as to live -- and make life 
hard for white.]

Black should resign.

White: Olli Lounela, 3 dan

31 Jun 1992

White wins by 15 points.

Commentary by OL, GP and
John Lamping, 1 kyu.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og]
;B[nf]C[OL: 'a' is joseki.]L[qe]
;W[qe]C[JL: Now White gets 
a move that, among other things, defends against the cut at 'a' in sente.]L[qg]
;B[qd];W[nc]
;B[oc]C[GP: Since I'm playing against a much stronger 
player, I fear the push-through-and-cut sequence starting at 'a'; also with 
this move I'm trying to defend the corner.

OL: This move defending against the cut is correct. The idea, however, should 
not be so much to defend as to attack.]L[pe]
;W[ob]
;B[pb]C[OL: 
This is a common mistaek. Black ends up in a very bad shape.

'a' would be normal, were the marked stone absent. However, having played it, 
black can no longer expect a good result from 'a'. Nevertheless, 'a' is the 
vital point.

JL: What would the sequence be if Black played 'a' and White ataried?

OL: Black just connects, and if white connects some way, the other side can 
be cut at will. Remember that 'b' will be sente against 'c'.]M[nf]L[nd][rd][qg]
;W[od];B[pc]
;W[pe]C[OL: This is very much of an overplay. White 
is seriously suffering from shortage of liberties.

JL: It does my 1 kyu heart good to see Ollie be fallible.  What should White 
have done?

OL: This is a matter of completely different class. It's extremely hard to 
find a good move for white here.

One idea that springs to my mind is 'a', but then connecting at the marked 
stone is sente.

No wonder I don't give myself 9 stones... :-\)]M[pe]L[ld]
;B[nd]C[GP: Trying 
to split White.

OL: The correct move. Cutting at 'a' would be worse as black's shape would be 
horrible and white's top position would be substantially strengthened when 
compared to the correct result... \(cf. move #19\)]L[oe]
;W[oe];B[ne]
;W[mc]C[OL: ...which is this.

Neither white group has good shape, nor are they strong. This is an excellent 
result for black.]
;B[re]C[OL: This is worng. Black should cut at 'a' 
and capture either side.

JL: Black's corner is not weak, because Black can always play 'b' to get a 
second eye, if necessary.]L[qg][nb]
;W[rf]
;B[nb]C[OL: Connecting 
at 'a' is urgent. It would threaten a cut at 'b' and thus be sente. After 
that black could start tormenting the top.

The marked move is locally no good either. It captures a stone, but 
strengthens white, and worst of all, is gote. A locally better move would be 
'c' or 'd'.]M[nb]L[rd][qg][kc][le]
;W[mb];B[oa]
;W[le]C[OL: Now white escapes. 
This is a mistaek, however. White should defend at 'a'.

JL: I take it that White is prepared to sacrifice the three marked stones if 
Black cuts at 'b'?

OL: He's prepared to do whatever proves necessary. The main purpose is to 
prevent black from sealing white in immediately with 'b'.]M[mb][nc][mc]L[qh][ld]
;B[ng]C[JL: Would peeping at 'a' or cutting at 'b' have been better?

OL: I would call this move good enough.

Peeping is bad, it is aji-keshi. Black wants to cut at 'b' instead at some 
time. However, I cannot escape the feeling that 'b' immediately would be 
letting white off the hook by letting him sacrifice a few stones.

This is certainly the vital point of the shape.]L[qh][qg]
;W[oi]C[OL: Now 
defending at 'a' is too late, as black would seal white in at the marked 
stone.]M[oi]L[qh]
;B[qg];W[rd];B[rc];W[se]
;B[rg]C[OL: This captures white.]
;W[sc];B[rb];W[qh];B[rh];W[nh]
;B[ph]C[GP: With this move I 
save the marked group, but hurt the center one.

OL: But even so it is correct. Capturing the white group clearly outweighs 
any harm to black's center.

White is, BTW, rather cleverly salvaging all that is possible out of a 
disaster. There still is some ko aji to the dead group.

JL: Would a move like 'a' be better for Black?  The big White group would 
still be captured, Black would be out in the center more, and the top White 
group would look pretty sad.

OL: No, this is correct. 'a' would be promptly answered by 'b' and the side 
handicap stone would suffer. Even after another white move in the center 
there's still plenty of possibility of cutting, so there's no hurry.]M[ph][qg][rg][rh][pj]L[lg][qi]
;W[oh]
;B[qi]C[OL: Excellent.]
;W[mg]
;B[sf]C[GP: 
The only chance to rescue the center group is this ko.

OL: True. Very true, but still this move is worng.

Better would be to play the ko as black 'a' - white marked stone - black 'b'.

JL: Is 'a' better because it leaves Black with more territory in case he 
loses the ko?

OL: Ooops... this question is a toughie! Took me a while to figure out just 
why.

An obvious improvement is leaving one less ko threat here for white. Another 
is giving black about 3 points of extra territory in case white wins the ko. 
And a less obvious one is that black would be left with a better eye shape 
just in case.]M[sf]L[sg][sb]
;W[sg];B[sh]
;W[fc]C[OL: White cannot start the ko 
yet. He has no liberties, and losing the group with no compensation would be 
unthinkable.

So white forgets about the right side for the time being and plays elsewhere.

The ko is not a simple one to figure out. It may become a direct ko, but that 
depends on sente.

If it's white's sente, he just fills in at 'a' and it's a direct ko since at 
any stage when it's white's turn to make a threat, white also has two 
liberties.

However, if black starts, it's a one-step ko where white needs to ignore two 
threats to win.

The value of the ko is about 34 points, plus thickness and the security of 
the groups to the left and below. Using two moves to it would amount to less 
than 20 points per move, and even less if we account for the ko. There are 
bigger moves around.]L[mf]
;B[sf]C[OL: Capturing the group is not urgent. 
Black should play at 'a' instead.]L[df]
;W[ee]
;B[re]C[GP: I think I can live 
in the corner, so I close the ko. But the three stones white gets to play 
give him a big influence, that I'll have to cope with.

OL: And lots of almost-territory besides.

Black's stubbornness in capturing the dead stones helps white; now white has 
recovered from his mistaeks.]
;W[cf]
;B[oj]C[GP: Now that the marked group is 
safe, I felt confident that I could save the middle top handicap stone easily, 
so I try to build a moyo in the lower right. Maybe I should have played 
somewhere in the lower left; If I had to play there, I'd play at 'a', to 
keep the balance towards the left and lower side.

OL: Safe, indeed, but wasting three moves to it...

The black ponnuki to the right of the actual move makes this superfluous. 
Playing in the bottom left would be good. I would recommend 'b'.]M[nf][ng][ne][nd][of][pf]L[cq][fp]
;W[nq]
;B[np]C[JL: Since Black is so thick 
above, I'd want to play at 'a' instead to start pushing White into Black's 
strength, strengthening Black on the left and taking territory on the right.

OL: Actually that is little better. White would be guaranteed a base on the 
side.

The way to attack would be black 'b', white 'c', black 'd'. However, that 
would resemble too much making territory in front of thickness to suit me. 
Another, and perhaps the best way to attack is 'e'.]L[oq][lq][no][pn][or]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq]
;W[qn]C[OL: White is still badly behind, so he tries 
to create confusion.]
;B[pn]C[GP: Since the upper right gave me so many 
troubles, I tried something different.

OL: The upper right was, after all, satisfactory, so nothing different is 
needed. 'a' would seem better.]L[qo]
;W[qo]
;B[po]C[GP: At this point I felt a 
little overconcentrated.

OL: Little is rather an understatement. The thickness above is doing nothing 
now.]
;W[rq]
;B[rp]C[GP: I want a little base for my group in the corner.

OL: White wants to live independently on the side, so as not to harm the 
bottom group.

A better course of action would be to attack the bottom.]
;W[qp];B[rr];W[qq];B[qr];W[qk];B[qm];W[rm]
;B[rl]C[GP: There's no way to prevent white 
from connecting, then I sacrifice two stones with the sequence up to 79 in 
order to keep sente.

OL: Playing at 'a' would be a better way of getting out of here in sente. 
Sacrificing stones is not necessary here.]L[pm]
;W[ql];B[pm]
;W[ro]C[OL: This 
result is excellent for white. Black had territory with a very strong 
position here. Now there is only overconcentration, and the territory is 
white's.]
;B[rk]C[OL: This move is a bit in doubt, since it seems a bit of an 
aji-keshi. However, what follows is much worse aji-keshi. Better to end the 
exchange at the very least before the marked stones get removed...]M[rl][rk]
;W[rj];B[qj]
;W[sl]C[OL: ...which is here. Due to shortage of liberties white 
cannot get out anymore anyway.

JL: What aji did Black have here?

OL: The white stones below the cutting stone did not have two definite eyes 
yet. At the very least black loses several ko threats, and besides...]
;B[pl]
;L[pk]C[OL: ...now there exists some aji of a cutting point if white 
pushes at 'a'.]W[sk]
;B[mo]C[GP: Again, I think that playing in the lower 
left was bigger.

OL: Not necessarily.

This is, however, a worng way to attack. The way to use a wall is to squish 
one's opponent against it. 'a' would steal white's eyes and force him into 
run.]L[lr]
;W[fq]
;B[eq]C[GP: If white 'a', the marked stone is in the 
right place to limit white development.

OL: White is grateful for this tsuke, however, since he gets strengthened and 
has some potential for a connection across the bottom.]M[jp]L[fp]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[lp]
;B[ko]C[GP: Maybe 'a' or 'b' was better and more solid.

OL: Normal would be pushing at 'c' and aim for peeping at 'd'.]L[jo][jq][lo][lr]
;W[jq]
;B[kq]C[JL: This sacrifice doesn't seem to work so 
well, because Black doesn't really want White to play at 'b'.  Simply 
playing at 'a' seems better for Black.

OL: Actually, there's nothing worng with this move, as long as black doesn't 
consider the connection at 'c' necessary. See variation B.]L[iq][kp][lo]
(
;W[kp]
;B[lo]C[OL: This is the mistaek.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[kr];B[iq];W[jr]
;B[hp]C[OL: White is rather satisfied here. Now the connection has 
materialized. However...]
;W[fm]C[OL: ...white first probes whether it is 
necessary.]
;B[io]C[GP: Before capturing, I should have played 'a'.

OL: 'a' would be helping white, since he does not mind getting cut. He has a 
connection at 'b'.]L[fn][hr]
;W[dl]
;B[fo]C[JL: This looks like a mistake, 
since it doesn't really threaten any of the White groups, and leaves the 
corner open.  Maybe 'a' would have been better.

OL: This is true. However, playing at 'a' would leave irritating aji behind: 
a move around 'b' would be just about sente.

I'd prefer playing at 'c' and be done with it.]L[er][cm][cq]
;W[cq]C[OL: White 
is prepared to sacrifice the two marked stones, if necessary.]M[fq][fp]
;B[dq]
;W[eo]C[OL: Here I was hampered by pestering by a friend. A disaster 
follows.]
;B[en];W[do];B[co];W[ep]
;B[fr]C[OL: The five white stones are 
dead.]
;W[bo]C[koko 5d  good !

OL: Once again white prepares to salvage whatever possible after a terrible 
blunder. If white loses the five stones without compensation, the game is 
over.]
;L[cp]B[bn]C[tsand 2k  what is that?
koko 5d  hopeless try

OL: Just about. Only, black mistaeks. White is left with the aji of living in 
the corner.

JL: What should Black have done instead?

OL: Killing the corner with 'a' seems adequate.]
;W[gj]C[koko 5d  
next fight is at m16 \('a'\) for B

GP: White is building a huge moyo on the left side.

OL: The only way he can try for winning.]L[ld]
;B[hi]C[giovax 7k \(of white's 
move\): A hard move to answer.

GP: With this move I hoped to reduce white moyo, and tried to attack on a 
large scale the group on the right.

OL: If white gets the whole left side, he still has hope. Attacking the white 
group at the top right seems to be the most effective way for black to win.

JL: What move would you suggest for Black?

OL: 'a' would seem good enough.]L[ld]
;W[gi];B[hh];W[gh]
;B[hg]C[OL: Now 
white is no longer worried by the left side. Black cannot steal in between 
the two marked stones...]M[gh][ee]
;W[cl]C[GP: This move keeps me from 
connecting the marked stone.

OL: ...so he secures the left side. And what a huge side it is!]M[dj]
;B[gl]C[GP: Treating the marked stone lightly.

OL: The left side is worth 30 points. Rather big to treat lightly :-\)]M[dj]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[fk];B[hj]
;W[hm]C[OL: The only way to try and reduce. Only, 
white will have to choose between an effective reduction, and living in the
corner.

Of the two choices, living in the corner is clearly bigger.]
;B[gm];W[gn]
;B[hk]C[GP: 'a' and 'b' are miai, then I can connect.

OL: Not exactly. White can play 'a' since it is an atari, and connect at 'b' 
also. This would force black 'c' and give him the hint to kill the corner, 
however.]L[fn][hn][go]
;W[li]C[OL: So white tries for another approach to the 
problem. Reducing the center from the other side.]
;B[lg]C[GP: I try to 
attack; as koko stated earlier, it should have been at 'a'.]L[ld]
;W[mf]
;B[lh]C[OL: This kind of move is usually very bad, and here it is dubious. 
Black fills in his own liberties, as white already has a hane at the end of 
two stones \(the marked stone\).]M[li]
;W[mh];B[lf]
;W[jg]C[GP: lounela 
commented he liked his shape: how can I contradict him? ;\)

OL: I was feeling irresponsible. The game had become such a mess that I no 
longer cared about who wins.

This move does not work, but it is such an attractive shape I could not 
resist :-\)]
;B[kf];W[me]
;B[jf]C[OL: Good.]
;W[jc]C[OL: This move does not 
work, as we shall see shortly.]
;B[ld]C[GP: Too late! Now it 
would be better to peep at 'a', and if white 'b', 'c' makes territory at the 
center.

OL: Not so. This move is actually very, very difficult to handle...]L[mj][mi][lj]
;W[kd]C[OL: ...and white promptly mistaeks.

White should play at 'a' and hope for the best. Note, BTW, that white will 
soon play at 'a' anyway.]L[md]

commented, I should have connected at 'a'; then, I think white marked stone,

first. That makes an enormous difference.]M[ma]L[kb]

skill in endgame besides. I'm still very proud of this move. Looks like I 
decided to forget whatever had happened and try to win.

'a' instead would be worng.

Reducing my own liberties: what a great idea! This is a fatal blow if not

sufficient.]L[bf]

happens here can be described as white sacrificing a point to gain sente.

;W[qo];B[op];W[mq]
;C[This is the first mistake. It should be at Q3.

When compared with a joseki, the P4 stone ends up in an awkward position.

R3 in answer is a tesuji.]B[qp]
;W[qq]
;C[This is a bad move. Connecting underneath in sente gives white a good result. Black's shape will be heavy.

The normal move would be Q4, but this would leave P4 in ridiculous position. Even so, it whould probably be better.]B[pq]
;W[rp];B[pp]
;C[This move seems doubtful. Nevertheless, it's very difficult to think of anything else to do.]W[rr]
;B[qr];W[rq]
;C[A dangerous, foolhardy move. The black group below is heavy, and making this two-point jump just gives white a weakness to exploit.

Better moves include P6 and particularily O5. White will get a good result by extending along the left side, however, and this is why R4 and R3 were bad in the first place.]B[om]
;C[White decides to exploit the weaknesses immediately. This may be a bit premature, though.

If white extended along the bottom side, black would have trouble defending his corner. The only possible move seems to be at R7. This, however, would be difficult to answer, because white's own corner would be in danger. Thus, white complicates the situation.]W[on]
;B[nn];W[pn]
;C[This move is clearly bad. Even though white can't cut immediately at O5, the cut at O7 becomes very severe -- and sente.

A normal move here would be to draw back to O5, and if white cuts, then atari at N7 and connect around M6 or M4.]B[pm]
;C[White would probably better off cutting at O7. However, this simplifies things for white since after this the corner definitely lives. This move is also sente threatening to cut at O5.]W[qm]
;B[no];W[nm]
;C[Black should first atari at N7.]B[lp]
;C[This move has tremendous influential value. Besides making it impossible for black to get any kind of moyo anywhere except perhaps the bottom, it also virtually kills the two black stones while aiming at making a moyo on the left side.

The bottom is small compared to this. Already black seems to have lost more than one hancicap stone]W[mm]
;B[lq]
;C[This is interesting strategy. White is trying to make black overconcentrated in the bottom while retaining sente to make a kakari on the right side.]W[cn]
;B[fp]
;C[White lightly skips away hoping to get sente. If black approaches from above, white will tenuki.]W[dj]
;C[This would seem to be a typo. The usual point to play in the top is either K17 or K16. The top right side is too open for an invasion.]B[id]
;C[The last really big point.]W[qf]
;C[This is a mistaek in direction. The left side is not urgent and the white group there is light and thus difficult to attack.

I would play O17 and patiently answer white S16 and any subsequent kikashis to gain sente.

A white tenuki would make R14 a perfect target and so is impossible.]B[cg]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]
;C[A nice, light move. The white qroup on the right side can't be attaked, thanks to N7. The top white group is too light to mount an effective attack. The game is developing very nicely for white.]W[kd]
;B[og];W[ph];B[oh];W[pi]
;C[Attacking from the other side takes priority. I would play the combination of K17, K14. This would also create a nice moyo on top left.]B[nd]
;W[md]
;C[It looks like black is trying to kill this group while he should be doing just the opposite. If white lives small and black gets thickness outside, the game may yet be better for black.

Note also, how this stone ends up captured and wasted.]B[lc]
;W[kc];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[nb]
;C[This cut is actually almost worthless. White is just about alive.]B[me]
;W[le];B[mf]
;C[By securing this group, white takes a big leap toward victory. Now white has but one weak group.

White seems to think that the game is almost over already.]W[lb]
;C[This is a strange shape. White can live with the sequence P18, Q18, P19 or run to the center. Thus, this doesn't really threaten white and so is not sente.

A better move would be at E17. This would secure the corner and aim at attacking the white group on the left side.]B[jb]
;C[An enormous move.]W[dc]
;C[This move is strange, and doesn't seem to do much anything. White will live easily in the corner, and black's territory here will shrink to next to nothing.]B[ed]
;C[White takes it easy and makes sure of his eyes.]W[cc]
;C[While necessary, and painful besides, this move leaves the black top weak. Also, note how white makes almost as much territory here than black.]B[ec]
;W[be];B[ce];W[bf]
;C[This is bad and does almost nothing. White will still have C11, which besides being sente makes any attack on white below an order of magnitude more difficult.]B[dh]
;C[This, while a bit risky, is big. White intends to make black overconcentrated all the while creating spare eyes for the group.

Securing the left side would probably be better.]W[ie]
;B[jd];W[je]
;C[This is bad. If the hane at H15 doesn't work, H16 is the only move.]B[ge]
;C[White gets to flatten black's position here in sente.]W[hd]
;B[hc];W[he];B[gc]
;C[Now the white top group is almost as safe as can be. Besides having a spare eye sequence starting with P18, it now has lots of thickness and an open access to centre. Thus, white tenukies.

B4 is an extremely important point. Besides being big, it also plays an important role in the security of this whole white group.]W[bp]
;B[cq];W[en]
;C[Black's last chance is to get a really big territory in the bottom. However, it would seem to me that white is already leading by about 10 points in territory.

This actually means the game is just about over, because white has no weak groups anywhere.]B[gn]
;C[This shallow reduction may seem strange, but it's probably the best white can do. Entering any deeper would be dangerous, and white doesn't even need to do anything more to win.

This move clearly states that white knows the situation and thus can be considered a declaration of victory.]W[jo]
;B[kn];W[jn]
;C[This is too aggressive. There is no way black's net will hold white.

While black may get to capture the two white stones and several more, all white needs to do is make a dent in the bottom. There seems to be no way to prevent this.

L7 would probably be a bit better. But actually, I would play J4.]B[jm]
;W[im]
;C[Black seems to believe white and promptly makes a doubtful move. A move that seems better would be J4. If white then pushes through at K4 and cuts, black just pushes to J5 in sente and should have no trouble.]B[iq]
;W[jq];B[jr]
;C[It is very big and very nice to be able to connect J6 in sente. White is happy.]W[ip]
;B[hq];W[jl];B[fl]
;C[White is convinced the bottom group won't get into trouble and secures the left side.]W[el]
;C[This is a big mistaek. This doesn't threaten the white group to the right, and white gets ponnuki by capturing at L7. The ponnuki makes absolutely sure, that the white group in the bottom will be just about perfectly safe.]B[oi]
;W[km]
;C[This does not work.]B[pj]
;W[oj];B[qi];W[rh];B[ri]
;C[A very clever move, this ensures a good result for white. By making two eyes for the group above, this makes sure the three black stones cannot get away.

The best black can do is to atari at O10 and try to construct some territory there.]W[qj]

;C[This and the next move are aji-keshi and lose lots of ko-threats.]B[qk]

In that case black definitely would _not_ want to peep at K4, to which white of course would be happy to answer by connecting at J4.

That, however, is effectively just what black has done.]W[ip]
;B[bp]C[Black secures some territory and robs white's group of eyes. This, however, has the adverse and very distasteful \(for black that is :-\) effect of forcing white to connect his two weak groups.

No good.]
;W[gn]C[White is very happy to play here. He now has little in the way of problems.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]
;W[nq]C[White seems to be feeling playful. While this move is not bad, it isn't necessarily good either. The aim of white is to make black sweat a little and try out his nerves.

However, looks like white does need to do domething bigger than just letting black live peacefully. So, this is an active choice and definitely a possible move. White actually seems a bit ahead now.]
;B[op]
;W[mp]C[The proper shape.]
;B[no]C[Not the proper shape. Black should push up at P5 and then run into centre. O5 will just end in dubious or even bad shape.]
;W[mo];B[nn]
;W[ql]C[Good. White secures this group, and clearly takes the lead.

Note, BTW, that R9 would be too greedy as it would leave a bothersome invasion at R7. Better to play safe.]
;B[mn];W[ko];B[rr]
;W[qj]C[Excellent. The aim of this move is none other than to live by expanding the territory, if only a little.

R10 also threatens somewhat the black group above...]
;B[oi]C[...and black shows that he worries about his group enough to defend it in gote.]
;W[bo]C[White feels confident and starts the endgame.]
;B[cq]
;W[fe]C[Enormous. The difference between white F15 and black G16 is just unbelievable.

White is doing well enough and just about securing the game.]
;B[ff];W[gd];B[gf]
;W[qe]C[Also very big.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[qg];W[se]
;B[rh]C[This is a mistaek. Black should play Q14 in sente so as to have a strong group here. That would open all kinds of possibilities in the centre.]
;W[sf];B[ok]
;W[ri]C[White is not sure wether this group lives, but is not willing to gamble it either. White's attitude feels overconfident and lazy, however.]
;B[kf]C[Extremely large. This move actually throws the result of the game in doubt. White will again have to work for it.

While defending at S11 was understandable, it nevertheless feels a bit slack.]
;W[ln]C[White plays carefully and reduces black's center while increasing his side.

The move M6 is very important, however, even if not very large. Just imagine black playing at L7 instead.]
;B[ll]C[Incomprehensible. Black is trying not to surround the center in large enough scale.]
;W[ol]C[Nice timing. Later black might not answer, and now it is large.]
;B[nl];W[pk];B[nk]
;W[dg]C[This move requires a bit of explanation.

First, it is not quite as dangerous as it seems. Black will have to connect somehow, and that gives black a chance to exploit the aji around here.

Second, white is not necessarily planning to live or escape. A good sacrifice sequence will be satisfactory result.

Third, the aji around seems to just about guarantee that white can either escape or live.]
;C[Slightly dubious. Black shows he's trying to kill, but is playing too close. That helps white more than black.

If white gains just a few more liberties, the cut at E14 will be a real threat.]B[ch]
;W[dh];B[ef]
;C[White seems just about secure.

Black's C12 looks really funny now.]W[ci]
;B[cg]
;C[White makes his intentions clear. He's not trying to live or escape. He's reducing the side as much as possible, and escaping with the lower two stones, even while leaving a bit of aji behind.]W[cj]
;B[di];W[ck];B[dk];W[bl]
;C[I do not understand this move. It's just helping white while yielding a few points.]B[bm]
;W[cm];B[dl]
;C[This move is debatable.

The hanging connection of B10 seems possible, but I had a definite idea as to why not to play it. I was aiming at C14, and in that case having three liberties below instead of four might be a burden.

White is playing very safe, and he has a clear lead again.]W[bk]
;C[Very, very big, but not nearly as big as white's successful reduction of the left side.]B[jd]
;C[Also very big.]W[hj]
;C[This is slightly dubious \(the reason follows after a couple of moves\).]B[hk]
;W[ik]
;C[This would be good if it worked. But, since it doesn't, it and the previous moves are cast in doubt.]B[ij]
;W[gk];B[hi];W[gj];B[gi]
;C[This is the reason. Since this move is sente and white gets the sente to atari at K10 \(and captures a stone while making a bit of territory in the process\), black loses points here.]W[fk]
;B[fi];W[jj];B[ii];W[kk]
;C[Big, but not big enough, since white gets sente.]B[li]
;W[ie];B[je]
;C[An important point, this also makes a peep at K8 impossible.]W[ki]
;B[kh]
;C[Also very big, and besides, a skillful sacrifice sequence.]W[cf]
;B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[bd];B[bi];W[ce];B[df]
;C[White got all he wanted from the top left and now takes the biggest point. The game is over and black should resign.]W[nr]
;B[so]
;C[The only move. S5 would not work nearly as well here. Playing T3 guarantees white a good shape or \(if black is greedy\) sente.

The sequence after W s5 would be B T4, W S6, S3, S4, T3, S6. That would guarantee black sente and white bad shape, with just about no difference in points.]W[sq]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[sp];W[sn]

 testx NR  I am surprised by these moves.

OL: There's nothing special about them. They are, if anything, even more usual in pro games than the 'standard' play of S5 intead of T3.

T3 is a kind of guarantee that black will not do anything unexpected.]

OL: But not the best.

This move is very large, by the way.]
;B[gr]C[
 wer NR  or does he just give up 5points for sente?

OL: Exactly. White's getting sente means that black has bungled rather badly. It's not 5 points, BTW, but more like 2.]
;W[ir]
;B[om]C[
 testx NR  Definitely not.

OL:  :-\)  Definitely yes.]
;W[pm]C[OL: Very good style, giving up a couple of points and gaining a couple of sentes while tenukiing.]
;B[pl]C[
 testx NR  Black can choose T2 instead of S5, if he wants to be sente.
 wer NR  right.  so it cost w about 5 p to take sente there

OL: Just about. Sente was quite a bit larger than those two \(sic!\) points.]
;W[sh]C[
 zj NR  b  can play r5
 zj NR  then r6

OL: White wants to play it safe now. He's more than 20 points ahead, and knows it. He also is very sure of the victory and does not want to bungle it by being impatient.

Commentary by OL.]PL[B]
;B[dd]C[This is a most unpolite start. Even though most players do not know or care, the correct corner to start is the top right one.]
;W[qo]C[White is slightly irritated because of black's unpoliteness and starts an unorthodox strategy.]
;B[dq]
;W[oc]C[Very unusual.]
;B[dk]
;W[pq]C[White seems to be planning an aggressive strategy.]
;B[qd];W[qg];B[od];W[nd]
;B[pc]C[Bad. White gets all too much thickness.]
;W[oe];B[pd]
;W[ob]C[This is risky. Even if the ladder after B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' does not work, creating weaknesses like this is dangerous.]L[ne][md][of]
;B[pb]C[But black helpfully gives white a chance to fix thing up...]
;W[ne]C[...which he promptly uses.]
;B[rf]C[Too small and too slow. This only helps white in increasing his thickness.]
;W[qf]
;B[rg]C[This also helps white in creating thickness.]
;W[re]C[The only move. Sacrificing a stone makes white's resulting thickness much stronger.]
;B[qe];W[rh];B[rd];W[sg];B[se]
;W[qh]C[Again the only move.

Note how white has a large moyo in the bottom right quadrant of the board and potential for territory everywhere while black's left side looks open for invasion and his top right territory is amusingly small.

The game seems easy for white.]
;B[jc]C[Worng direction. Bottom is the most important area.]
;W[gp]C[Excellent point. Now white has a moyo the size of half the board.]
;B[do];W[jp]
;B[jj]C[Black's top left moyo is not nearly as secure as white's bottom right, thanks to white's thickness at the top right.]
;W[cf]C[Good timing. Invading immediately after the enemy has reinforced.]
;B[ch]
;W[cc]C[White does not mind giving black a wall here, the white wall to the right makes any wall in that direction useless and any wall facing down the left side would be hopelessly overconcentrated.]

;B[oo]C[The vital poit for reducing the white moyo.]

;C[Black is exposing himself. K6 seems better.]B[hh]
;C[Excellent timing; just after black has defended and right before black's shape will be completed, white ruins it.]W[jh]
;C[This is a bad shape; J6 would be better. Then if white peeps at K5, black would be a bit further out and besides, white would get a bad shape \(empty triangle\).

Black can't cut at G4. After H4 and F5, white would cut at J5 and kill the corner.]B[ji]
;C[Spoiling black's shape even further. White must have been enjoying this.]W[ih]

;C[G6 would be better. This has little effect on the empty corner as white has poked his head out at G5.]B[hf]
;C[Necessary reinforcement.]W[le]
;B[ld]
;C[White makes a hard choice: live in gote on the right side and cede upper left corner to black, or leave the half-dead group and pretend it's alive.

If black got a stone in the upper left corner, the game would be over. White must thus play at C6 and pretend his right side lives.]W[ch]
;B[ci];W[dh];B[ek]

Without F2 the bottom white group would be almost dead. F2 helps the group quite a bit.]W[fl]

;B[el]C[This is not very good. The corner might be biggish, but it certainly is smaller than either D6 \(playing safe\) or, particularily, cutting at G5.

Actually, cutting at G5 would put white on the spot; the subsequent fighting would be very difficult for white.]
;W[hk]C[Good choice. This eliminates any danger to this position and leaves white's hands free to cause black trouble elsewhere.]

;W[kb]C[White understandably does not feel like defending the \(already cut\) almost-connection on the right side. White definitely lives with this move.]
;B[lh]C[This descent in nevertheless big.]
;W[he]C[White tries to use the bad aji black has hereabout. The real threat is to cut either of black's connections below.]
;B[hd]
;W[fe]C[White is very happy to make territory here.]
;B[gd];W[ee]
;B[me]C[Big and sente, but not deadly.]
;W[md];B[mf];W[mb];B[lc]
;W[ja]C[This shoud be the fatal mistaek. White dies at M13, after which M12 and L13 are miai -- voila, only one eye.]
;B[ld]C[Black misses the chance.]
;W[le]C[After this white is alive: if black M13, W L13, M12, N7 makes two eyes by capturing the whole corner.]

;C[White starts the endgame. This is big as it is double sente.]W[em]
;B[dm];W[fm]
;C[This is also big, 6 points in sente. However, the bottom left was four points in double sente, and thus bigger.]B[mk]

;B[fc];W[lk];B[mj];W[ml];B[li];W[lj];B[mi]
;C[White judges this bigger than the bottom right corner. He is right, this is 6 points in sente and the other is about equal, 6 points, but in gote.]W[dl]
;B[ll];W[kl]
;C[Black realizes N1 is small, and tries to get something here. This, however, is no bigger than N1, being 3 points in sente, but the crucial difference is that it is sente.]B[jk]
;W[lm];B[jj];W[jl];B[cl];W[cm];B[bm]

;C[However, connecting this ko seems to make certain of a narrow victory. The rest of the endgame does not require any commenting.

White did not make much in the way of mistaeks, but his two proved too much. After that the game was uphill struggle.]B[cd]

All comments by OL.]
;W[qf]
;B[qj]C[This move is slightly dubious. Since its on the 3rd line, white's stone at R14 is light and thus a double pincer is called for.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc];W[od];B[pf]
;W[md]C[The tight connection is correct. First, it leaves no bad aji for black to exploit. Second, it aims at pulling out the lone white stone at R14. Third, it sets aim at creating a moyo on the upper side. Beside all that, it is joseki.]
;B[mf];W[lf]
;B[lg]C[This is very risky. It will take considerable skill to defend all these cutting points, if at all possible, especially as there are no weaknesses in white's position.]
;W[rd]C[And sure enough, white gets to work immediately. After this cut, there is no way for black to get a good result.

White plans to either surround black using black's shortage of liberties \(W O14, B N13, P14, Q15, Q13\) or to connect underneath while taking all the territory.]
;B[re]C[Black decides to take the territory. This atari, however, does nothing to the shortage of liberties...]
;W[pi]C[...so white first plays a necessary kikashi \(well timed, though\)...]
;B[pj]
;W[nf]C[...and then goes ahead and cuts.]
;B[ng]C[This seems bad. There is no way giving white a ponnuki in the center will be good for black.

It would be better, even though *very* painful, for black to play N13, W P14, Q15, Q13, T16, O12. Black would have to live in gote in what previously was his territory, and white's stones at O12 and Q11 would connect P13. Anyhow, black could still aim at attacking the right side group.]
;W[mg]
;B[of]C[This atari shows how bad black's situation is. It is necessary, for P13 would give white black very bad aji in form of ko because of black's shortage of liberties: B P13, W R15, Q15, Q13.]
;W[nh]C[However, white gets a golden opportunity to atari...]
;B[mf];W[mh];B[oh]
;W[oi]C[...and cut black into pieces.]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[qh]
;W[rh]C[This move is slightly risky. White relies on the ko at O14 to save the three stones if black cuts at O11.

S11 would be safer, but might be too slack.]
;B[rg];W[rj]
;B[ni]C[Black cuts, sure enough...]
;W[oj]C[...white strengthens the weaker stones...]
;B[mi]C[...and black promptly proves white's tactics justified. While it is very difficult to do anything else, this move makes the ko at O14 too big for white to lose. Moreover, white has lots of local threats, and can even aim at killing the large black group if he wins the ko.]
;W[nf];B[og]
;W[mf]C[White feels he is doing well. He removes some loose ends by filling in the ko and thus makes very difficult for white to achieve anything.

Besides, this move is just about sente against the big black group.]
;B[rf]
;W[qn]C[This is a difficult point. It is not easy to know how to extend along the right side.

If W Q8, black will extend to R6 and take away white's spare eye\(s\).

If Q6, B Q8 seems to be disturbingly troublesome.]
;B[pl]C[This may be premature...]
;W[ql]C[... but sure enough white goes wrong in his answer. This move should be at Q7; black cannot resist, he has to hane at P7 or extend to P8 in bad shape.

R8 is too slack. White seems to be too satisfied with his good result in the upper right and slacks off.]
;B[pm]C[The vital point.]
;W[qm]C[Painful but necessary.]
;B[pn]
;W[gq]C[This is another very difficult point. It is not easy know how to play on the lower side.

This move perhaps makes it too easy for black to enlarge his moyo in front of his wall \(a strategical mistaek, BTW\) and thus makes the game perhaps a bit too difficult for white.

It may be J3 is better. However, these two moves \(J3 and G3\) are the only ones worth considering. Anything closer to black's wall would be too close, and H3 is bad shape.]
;C[This is slightly doubtful. Black is creating territory in front of his wall all the while white's P10 is ready to push into the moyo.]B[jq]
;C[Whote seems to be shocked by his getting lulled to \(almost\) asleep by his success in the upper right.

This move is very aggressive and expects white to gain a chance to invade the bottom right after living in the bottom left.

It is also a bit risky.]W[dn]
;B[eo]
;C[A good move, this makes a light shape and aims at reducing black's bottom right.]W[ho]
;C[Thus, black feels compelled to defend his moyo.]B[jo]
;C[As the proverb says, 'force before living'. With this move, white casts his eyes at connecting with bottom left, and also builds a bit of thickness.]W[en]
;B[fo]
;C[White is seeking eyes. After this move it will be very difficult to attack white's bottom left group.

White is also preparing to turn the tables on black and aims at attacking black's bottom left corner.]W[dr]
;C[This is very doubtful. Black is strengthening the weakest white group.

Once this white group lives, white will have little to worry about: his left side group is reasonably strong, and the bottom right moyo can be reduced efficiently by peeping at L4.

I would rather play at F6 and aim at attacking the white groups.]B[er]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[cr];W[es]
;B[qo]C[This move would seem to be a bit of an aji-keshi.]
;W[pk]C[Necessary. If black got to connect, white would have to grovel for a tiny life on the right side.]
;B[cj]C[This is a little dangerous. The black group below doesn't have eyes yet.]
;W[fc]C[Excellent timing.]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec];B[dc]
;W[ge]C[This move strengthens black, but it is extremely difficult to know what else to do.

Letting black push at G15 would be out of the question so, while painful, this seems necessary.]
;B[ff]
;W[dj]C[This actually was a typo, but since it is a possible choice, I decided to go on with it. The original idea was to play at E10, whereas the actual move is far more aggressive.

White is trying to reduce black's top right while strengthening his two stones below. The aim of this move is actually the black corner below.]
;B[ck]C[This looks like an overplay. Black seems to be staking the whole game into attacking the scattered and light white stones.

Hane at D11 would definitely be good enough.]
;W[dh]C[White accepts the challenge.]
;B[el]
;W[fl]C[An interestingly effective move. It seems very difficult to attack efficiently the scattered white stones after this move.

Besides, all the while the black corner below is getting weaker and weaker.]
;B[em]C[Aji-keshi.]
;W[fn];B[dk]
;W[go]C[A good, very calm move. With a single blow white secures his groups around bottom left. Now kosumi at C5 will be a real threat.]
;B[fk]
;W[gi]C[White is playing very lightly here. This move just about destroys the black moyo to the left without giving black an efficient way to move into his own moyo.

It may be, though, that C5 is bigger. However, white is not confident he will win if black turns the game into a moyo competition with a move around H13.]
;C[This is bad. It only strengthens white while forcing him to connect outside.

A better try would be G13.]B[ei]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[fh]
;C[Very big. I, however, would play at G14 in sente and aim at either cutting at G12 or pushing into white's moyo.]B[co]
;C[Big in the extreme. Now white has just about recovered from his slack play on the bottom side.]W[hg]
;C[This doesn't work.]B[gg]
;W[gh];B[hh];W[gf]
;C[Giving white the ponnuki at G13 secures this group for keeps while enlargening the top. I would tenuki, perhaps around N8.]B[cf]
;W[fg]
;C[While big, this is not urgent. Now white gets the chance he's been waiting for such a long time.]B[cn]
;C[Necessary preliminary to reducing the bottom further, and also a good reducing move by itself.]W[ol]
;C[This is wishy-washy. White's position is full of holes.]B[mn]
;W[oo];B[on]
;C[Slightly risky, but white is expecting a ko. Since all his groups, with the possible exception of bottom left, are secure, white aims at a very complete destruction of the bottom right moyo.

If black connects at Q5, white will play L4 and Q3, and be just about alive, though in ko perhaps.

A ko, however, would be fine with white.]W[op]
;B[oq]
;C[White complicates the situation. It now seems there is no way for black to kill all the white stones hereabout.]W[pq]
;C[A mistake white has been waiting for.]B[qq]
;W[po]
;C[A further mistake. Getting a ko here does not worry white since he has two absolute threats while black has none.]B[no]
;W[qp];B[np];W[ro];B[pr]
;C[Slightly risky. R2 is probably better.

Anyway, the game will be just about over if white wins this ko.]W[or]
;B[pp];W[qe];B[pe];W[pq]
;C[White might wish to answer this threat once at S17, but since black gets unlimited threats here anyway, white decides to end the ko.]B[oc]
;W[nq]
;C[This corner is much smaller than bottom right.]B[pb]
;C[White may be a bit too greedy. O18 would definitely secure victory.]W[mp]
;B[nk]
;C[White is aiming at the black group below, starting with a double attack at M6. However, cooling down a little bit might be called for.]W[nl]
;B[ml]
;C[This is unimportant. The attack at M6 is not too likely to succeed.]W[ok]
;C[A desperate last challenge.]B[jc]
;C[A good, cool move. Now black has no threats on this side.]W[ib]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[ob];W[nc];B[lc]
;C[R18 may be better. White expected this to be sente.]W[oa]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[id];W[hb];B[hd];W[gc]
;C[Black misses the vital points. They are L15 and K13.]B[jf]
;C[Destroying the eyes.]W[kd]
;B[jd]
;C[The situation is getting very hairy.

It is difficult to choose between this and K13.]W[jh]
;C[L13 is probably better.]B[kh]
;W[jg];B[kf];W[kg];B[lh]
;C[White takes black's eye away.]W[ke]
;B[if]
;C[Taking a liberty away is best. Because of this white gets to cut and make a ko.]W[ig]
;B[ld];W[le]
;C[Now all depends on who wins the semeai. White, however has a beautiful sequence up his sleeve.]B[qb]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[je];W[ka]
;C[This ko is black's only hope, but there is no way he can win it. There will be no threats big enough.]B[la]
;W[lb]
;C[Black will need to kill the whole group to stay in the game.]B[fp]
;W[mc];B[hr];W[hq];B[ir]
;C[This is a tesuji for connecting.]W[gk]

White: Olli Lounela, 3 dan

Black: wq, 3 dan

White wins by resignation.

Commentary by OL.]N[\(igs\) lounela\(white\) vs. wq\(black\)]
;C[This is considered unpolite. According to the etiquette of the game, the first move should be played in the top-right corner, right side quadrant.]B[dp]
;C[White considers black's unpoliteness a challenge and plays unconventionally. A sort of tit-for-tat.]W[qo]
;B[dc];W[oc];B[jd]
;C[Absolutely necessary. If black got the chance to make a shimari here after the extension to K16, the game would be exceedingly difficult for white.]W[de]
;B[dh]
;C[This tenuki is a cool choice. White makes some territory and starts building pressure on black.

Also, making the shimari is just about the biggest move on the board.

Jumping to F15 or playing any other move in top left can be considered too submissive. R16 is actually can also be considered a declaration of fighting spirit.]W[qd]
;C[Black seems overawed by white's fighting spirit. This is a slack move. Just about only thing it does is split white's side.]B[qi]
;C[Another cool move and another declaration of fighting spirit. White is actually saying: Do whatever you wish, I'm making territory and going to win for it.

Also, allowing your opponent to make two shimaris is traditionally considered bad.

Already one gets the feeling white is leading.]W[pq]
;B[kq];W[qk];B[qf]
;C[Finally white goes ahead and starts securing his weakest stone.

It looks like white has pretty well outplayed black in the fuseki.]W[ec]
;B[dd];W[ed]
;C[Unusual, and perhaps doubtful. Usually, if black pushes at D16, he is going to cut at E15. C15 feels much too slack.]B[ce]
;C[While it is very hard to say what is the correct way of playing here, this is likely a mistaek. With the benefit of hindsight, I now would probably cut. The situation is very difficult to play correctly, however, whatever the choice.

The worst white can do is probably E15 which black answers at C14 leaving white with a heavy group and making black's K16 stone work beautifully.]W[cf]
;B[df];W[ee]
;B[cd]C[A bad shape but a good move, C16 refuses white any and all help in settling his stones.]
;W[dg]C[While it is very painful to have to push black into very efficiently cutting white and to leave the top white group ajar, it probably is the best thing to do. It looks like the only way to salve anything of the situation.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[ch]
;B[bf]C[Good timing.]
;W[cg];B[fg]
;W[di]C[The only move.]
;B[gd]
;W[cn]C[A good move. White seems to have saved some of his face. Even if the top white group is just about dead, there is still aji, and white's left side group is fairly safe thanks to D11.

White has nicely minimized his losses.]
;B[fp]
;W[mq]C[Very big.]
;B[mp]C[To attach is much too greedy; L5 would be good enough. This only gives white all sorts of possibilities, and since white's corner is strong anyway, there's nothing black can hope to achieve. Also, black's bottom side is open and a perfect target for white's intentions.]
;W[lq]
;B[lp]C[Yet again too greedy. Black could still salve something by playing at L4. This would of course leave N4-M3 exchange as a loss, but still it would be better.]
;W[kr];B[jq]
;W[jr]C[This is how black pays for his greediness: white destroys much of black's bottom in sente. 

Even though white is crawling on the second line, there is no way black can afford a massive loss of territory here.]
;B[ir]C[A mistaek. Black has to crawl once more.]
;W[iq];B[hr]
;W[gq]C[A fantastic move. White shows some capability of reading -- black can't resist.]
;B[gr]
;W[fq]C[Adding insult to injury.]
;B[eq];W[ip]
;B[jp]C[Bad shape; K5 would be better.]
;W[jo];B[kp]
;W[gp]C[White very nicely connects in good shape.]
;B[fr]
;W[in]C[Honte \(the proper move\).]
;B[lr]C[Probably a misreading. This cut doesn't work and only helps white.]
;W[mr];B[ls];W[ms];B[nq]
;W[np]C[A very nice cut. With this one move white completely turns tables on black: now it's white who's doing the attacking and is taking the territory.]
;B[mn]
;W[op]C[This move is best. Even if it would seem attractive, O5 is much worse. P4 threatens the cut almost as much and besides traps the lone stone at O3 thus destroying just about all the aji here.

White really is doing well.]
;B[mc]C[Dangerous, but big.]
;W[oe]C[Good, cool move. White knows the situation and takes no risks. White is also looking forward for a chance to double-attack black's right side and bottom goups, and also invading black's top.]
;B[oi]
;W[ok]C[Threatening the cut at N5.]
;B[mk]
;W[ml]C[Again threatening N5.]
;B[ll]C[This move does not help any if white cuts at N5 and so is a mistaek.]
;W[mo]C[The long-awaited cut.]
;B[lo]C[Looks like black hasn't read this out. There is no way to save this group.]
;W[ln];B[no];W[ko]
;B[mo]C[I find it unbelievable black doesn't see what white is doing.]
;W[lm]C[The final move that kills black below.]
;B[pn]
;W[oo]C[Playing with good aji.]
;B[nl];W[mm];B[nk]
;W[nn]C[This is a mistaek. While it is understandable that white wants to take off the stones and simplify the situation, P7 was the best move.]
;B[om]
;W[me]C[Very big, reducing black's moyo potential to the left and also making an invasion at the top work.]
;C[Big, but not urgent. Defending the top side has much grater priority since if white lives there, it also threatens to bring the dead white group in top left back to life.]B[qn]
;C[Big in the extreme.]W[kc]
;C[A mistaek. Black cannot kill white.]B[ld]
;W[kd];B[le];W[ke];B[lf]
;C[A good move. It now looks like white is going to live easily while destroying all black's territory at the top.]W[hc]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[fb]
;C[A good choice. If white played J18, it would be much easier for black to try and kill.]W[hd]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[ga];W[lb];B[mb]
;C[A nice shape. White is alive.]W[if]
;C[Bug but it feels a bit slack.]B[bp]
;W[en];B[fi]
;C[Making good aji in almost-sente. White's left side group is completely alive now. White is ahead about 5 points on the board.]W[eh]
;B[fh]
;C[Making very sure black won't attack this group.]W[kg]
;B[lg]
;C[The weak point of the whole black position here.]W[qh]
;C[Black's submissive answer proves just how effective R12 was.]B[ri]
;C[Wonderful timing. White plays two kikashis to reduce black's territori right after he has played an extra move there and picks quite a lot of points in the corner in the process.

White's lead jumps to more than 10 points on the board.]W[rn]
;B[rm];W[ro]
;C[While it is understandable that black is reluctant to connect in another way, it really would be better. Black is going to suffer for this.

It will not be easy to explit this bad aji, however.]B[sm]
;W[qg]
;C[An all-or-nothing move.]B[pf]
;W[rf];B[re]
;C[Tight connection might be better. White, however, has his eye on the aforementioned weakness at R7.]W[rh]
;B[qe]
;C[Excellent tesuji. This makes sure black can't and white can connect.]W[pi]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[pj];W[og];B[sf]
;C[While making this ko may be dubious, it really is a flower-viewing ko for white. The burden is all on black.]W[sg]
;B[rg];W[ge];B[fe];W[rf];B[rd];W[qc];B[rg]
;C[A clever idea. White plans to let black take the ko if he dares and kill the top black group instead.

If black takes the ko and the black group dies, there will be absolutely no way for black to win.

This would be a good place to resign.]W[mg]
;B[sh];W[lh];B[mh]
;C[This atari is absolutely necessary.]W[nh]
;C[This move dooms black. Even if it may not work, black's last chance is to atari at L12 and than at L14 and hope he can secure eyes somehow.

Black's living at the top would not secure victory, however. White would still be ahead on the board.]B[mi]
;W[kh];B[mf];W[ng]

;C[Now the black group is very dead.]W[nc]
;B[rb]
;C[White takes no chances.]W[nb]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[dj]
;C[White plays very simply and safely. Since white is more than 20 points ahead on the board, losing a bit here does not worry him.]W[cj]
;B[ej]
;C[A safety first move.]W[bl]
;B[bm]

;B[cm];W[am];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[ci];B[cl];W[bi];B[ih]
;C[Very big. And sente.]W[em]

;C[White is all the time increasing his lead.]W[lk]
;C[A mistaek.]B[fo]
;C[A very, very big sente move.]W[lj]
;B[ni]
;C[With this move white makes more territory in the center \(where there formerly was none\) than he lost in the left side. Things are all the time running from bad to worse for black.]W[ij]
;B[ji]
;C[Black finally calculates the score and resigns.

BTW, I find it interesting, how white did nothing special after his success at the bottom but nevertheless black couldn't close the gap.]W[jj]

Commentary by OL.]N[\(igs\) lounela\(white\) vs. yao\(black\)]
;C[Slightly unusual.]B[oc]
;W[pp];B[dq]
;C[It's very unusual to omit the empty corner, but white has his reasons.

Most importantly, white wants to prevent black from making a shimari here. Also, white tries to play consistently, tries to make his stones co-operate.]W[pe]
;C[Black plays a semi-trick move whitch frustrates white's aim.]B[qg]
;C[The only move.]W[qd]
;B[qj]
;C[An interesting and old-fashioned move. This was popular during the 19th century, but no longer.]W[kc]
;C[Very, very big.]B[dc]
;C[Consistent but a bit slow. White considers the two black shimaries miai. The fuseki has so far been both players defying the other. Black plays modern and white more old-fashioned.]W[nd]
;B[nq]
;C[This is best. If black got the chance to play here, he would gain immediately a large side, and all the pressure would be on white.]W[jp]
;B[no]
;C[Much better than Q6.]W[qn]
;B[pr];W[qq]
;C[I think this is a mistaek. Black should defend his bottom right group somehow, perhaps at K2. Allowing M2, which takes away black's eye shape, is just too good for white.]B[hp]
;W[lq]
;C[This feels a bit too greedy.]B[iq]
;C[Possible only because of M2.]W[jm]
;C[Jumping to O7 should be better. Black is only strengthening white here -- he's likely to come to regret it soon enough.]B[ko]
;W[jo];B[kn]
;C[While it is hard to think of anything else to do, this shape feels shaky. White has lots of cutting points black can aim at. However, making a shapeless connection at K6 is repulsive as an idea.]W[ho]

;C[While this almost secures the group, giving black sente this way is risky. Black's cut at J7 is going to be very dangerous.

However, in this kind of situation it's hard to bring yourself to connect with a move like H8.

White is aiming at utilizing the cutting stone at M3.]W[km]
;B[do];W[de]
;C[Yet again I get the feeling black is trying to trick white. While this move *is* good enough, the gap on the left side feels just too large for my taste.]B[cg]
;W[ef];B[gc]
;C[Trying to cook up something against the C13 stone.]W[cm]
;B[dm];W[dl];B[cn];W[em];B[dn]
;C[White unravels his plans for all to see. This move is extremely big in itself, and also puts a lot of pressure on the single stone below and the black group to the right.

White considers D8, C7 and E7 kikashis.]W[cc]
;C[Interesting shape.]B[dk]
;W[el]
;C[This kind of move is usually bad, forcing your opponen to connect strongly while cutting yourself apart. Black must feel very sure about his forthcoming attack.]B[ck]
;W[cl];B[hr]
;C[Nicely timed peep. Later black might be able to answer differently, now he must connect.]W[gq]
;B[hq]
;C[Risky.

White has concluded that there is no good way to attack his bottom and lower left groups and takes the biggest point on the board. This move is almost sente. It's not easy, however, to see how white can save his groups if black really tries to do some killing.]W[db]
;C[The big and most severe cut.]B[im]
;C[The proper shape.]W[go]
;B[is];W[jr];B[ks]
;C[Connecting tightly is best. Now white is threatening something here.]W[io]
;C[Black has read out that W G2 does not work. This is a severe move separating white further.]B[il]
;W[lm];B[mn]
;C[White is doing also some reading, but actually he's hallucinating. This should not work.

However, as long as white gets out of here in sente, the big groups is not dead yet. It will be under *VERY* severe attack, though, and extremely difficult to save.]W[mp]
;B[ln];W[js];B[gr];W[np]
;C[This is a big mistaek. Now the sequence white read out does work. If black had played at N3 instead, white would have been in trouble.]B[op]
;W[oq];B[oo]
;C[And voila -- white is connected. A big success. The games starts looking interesting for white.]W[nr]
;B[po];W[mq];B[qp];W[pq]
;C[This is black's compensation, but I think that white got the better deal, getting D18 and all his groups secured.

Note that black's only territory is in the lower left corner. White has territory all over the board. The game looks grim for black.]B[qo]
;C[White does not need to go in deeper.]W[oj]
;C[Black has to do something pretty spectacular -- so he attacks by capping above. If he played below the reducing white stone, there would be no way for black to win the game territorially.]B[mj]
;C[White goes in deeper. He's relying on the sente descent S6 to keep himself out of real trouble.]W[qk]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[ok]
;C[Making eye space.]W[rj]
;B[ri];W[rn];B[rq]
;C[White is almost alive.]W[rl]
;B[sj]
;C[This ko is the best black can do, but since white has local threats, is seems there is no way black can win it.]W[sk]
;B[rk];W[ro];B[rp];W[rj]
;C[This, of course, is nowhere comparable to the ko.]B[fn]
;W[si]
;C[Since black also feels compelled to answer white's ko capture, the whole sequence is an astonishing success for white. Besides destroying black's biggest prospective territory, he also gets a few points there in sente.

Thet game seems to be just about over.]B[oi]
;C[A probe.]W[en]
;C[Black is trying to attack as severely as possible.]B[fo]
;C[Another probe. If black E4, then F4, G4, G7 and white is connected.]W[eo]
;C[This move, however, is even worse. Black is left the chance of raping the corner.]B[fp]
;C[With the advantage of hindsight, I'd say this is certainly a mistaek. If white lives below, inducing black to defend here is a loss.

However, I felt the pressure of being in the lead. It's not always easy to win a won game.]W[fj]
;B[ei];W[ep]
;C[If at D4, E3 will capture some stones.]B[eq]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[cr]
;C[This is unexplicable. Must be a thinko. There is no way black can win this semeai.

Instead, B6 whould have made a ko.]B[bp]
;W[bn];B[co]
;C[Now it's clear white wins the semeai. Most unfortunately for black, the shape after capturing also guarantees eyes. And furthermore, black's own group to the right needs reinforcement.]W[br]
;C[gaining a liberty, but black is still behind.]B[bm]
;W[bl];B[dr]
;C[This is best. Any other move leaves much more of bad aji.]W[ar]
;C[Connecting the group outside.]B[gm]
;C[A declaration of victory.

With this one single move white makes absolutely clear the games is won. Besides taking *lots* of territory, this move secures white's last even vaguely weak position -- all others are already rock-solid.

Black is trailing by more than 30 points. This would be a good place to resign.]W[nc]
;B[qr]
;W[or]C[White takes it easy, taking no risks.]
;B[cb]C[This is strange, I cannot see what black tries to achieve with this cut.]
;W[ec]C[White continues playing as solid as possible.]
;B[cd];W[dd];B[ce]
;W[bc]C[Another very solid move.

Note also how white's ponnuki affects the black stone to the right. This means there is absolutely no hope for black to gain more territory. Black should resign.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kb]
;W[lb]C[Yet again the most solid choice.]
;B[kd];W[ka];B[lc];W[kb]
;B[jd]C[Black gains somewhat from securing the stones here this easily.

White is far, far ahead, however.]
;W[ci]C[Destroying this territory is yet another big point. White doesn't mind giving black something as long as he gets compensation.]
;B[eg]
;W[cf]C[Now it is clear that white, besides destroying all black's territory \(or actually, moyo\) here, is aiming at a double attack on this group and the one at the top. Black definitely can't expect a good result after this.

Black resigns.]

controversy, as some felt Black
took unseemly tactical advantage
of sealing.  Though in the midst
of a fight on the right side,
this move forces a sente

Komi: 5 1/2

Played on rec.games.go from May 15 to September 13, 1990.]
;B[pd]C[\(1\) \(Jon\)  The 4-4 point \(star point, hoshi\) is one of the standard places to start in a corner.  It emphasizes play over the whole board, rather than the corner territory itself.]
;C[\(2\) \(Larry\) Taking the diagonally opposite corner prevents black from using a diagonal fuseki (black stones in diagonally opposite corners). Similarly, the choice of hoshi means that there is no asymmetry. However, it is not bad to have a diagonal fuseki, or to make the position asymmetrical.]W[dp]
;C[\(3\) \(J\) the 3-4 point \(komoku\) is again a standard play, striving for a balance between corner territory and outside influence.]B[pq]
;C[\(4\) \(L\) J's move also sets up the possiblity of a Chinese Fuseki \(if he plays next on Q9 or R9\). Although D17 is symmetrical, white usually doesn't counter with a white Chinese fuseki.]W[dc]
;C[\(5\) \(J\) He's reading my mind, as I expected.  By not making a corner enclosure \(shimari\), at say R5, black is allowing an attack on the corner \(kakari\) by white -- normally at Q5.  Black's strategy will be to counterattack the white invasion, making territory in the process. Black 5 also develops from the 4-4 stone. 

Viable alternatives would be to play a shimari at R5 or Q5, or a kakari at F3, C15 or D15.]B[qk]
;C[\(6\) \(L\) K9 is a nice extension from white's hoshi point, and also serves to reduce the influence of black's Chinese style fuseki. It also frustrate's black's strategy \(see above\). \[We'll see about that! :-\) J.\]]W[jp]
;C[\(7\) \(J\) Although answering White 6 or playing in the middle of the upper side would be very valuable moves, the most important seems to be the least-developed corner.  Black chooses the "high" kakari rather than the "low" move at C15, because the game as a whole is oriented toward the center.]B[de]
;C[\(8\) \(L\) The pincer is a nice move because it extends from white's formation in the bottom left corner, and also attacks black. However, because everything is pretty wide open, a non-pincer move would probably be just as good. Since white has pincered, it turns out that black's choice of a high kakari was a good one, since a pincer is less severe against a high kakari than a low kakari.]W[di]
;C[\(9\) \(J\) An attachment \(i.e., a play adjacent to an opponent's stone\) is a standard way to strengthen a stone that is under attack.  If Black can become strong in this area, he will improve his chances on the right side as well as limit White's chances on the lower left.]B[ec]
;C[\(10\) \(L\) I haven't read this out, but one wants to fight back against this attachment. However, the fighting should be easier for black because of white's wide pincer.]W[ed]
;C[\(11\) \(J\) The only move.  If White is allowed to connect here, Black's position will be in shreds.  \(Black could sacrifice the stone at E17, but that sacrifice will be more effective later, if it is made at all.\) ]B[dd]
;C[\(12\) \(L\) White wants to extend to C17, but then E16 would be caught in a ladder. F17 breaks the ladder.]W[fc]
;C[\(13\) \(J\) Continuing the fight...]B[eb]
;C[\(14\) \(L\) White can now extend to C17, the 3-3 point. This is the key point for life in the corner, so it makes the group much harder to capture. This is important, as White intends to sacrifice these stones.]W[cc]
;C[\(15\) \(J\) Black strengthens his weaker stones.  In situations like this, beginners often make the mistake of giving an atari, which strengthens only the opponent.  If Black plays E15, White is happy to connect at F16, all but capturing the two black stones above.  \(Black could consider this a sacrifice, but he gets very little compensation for his loss.\)  If BF16, then WE15 takes a vital Black liberty on the left.  The following play is complicated, but I found no way for Black to save his stones. 

\(White 12 at F17 looks like the same kind of beginner mistake, but it is actually White's best play in that position.  The corner stones are much weakened by BE18, but they are strong enough to be effectively sacrificed.  If "beginner mistakes" were always bad, the game of go would be much less interesting.\)]B[fb]
;C[\(16\) Starting a fight against the stones on the left by pushing against them.]W[ee]
;C[\(17\) Again defending the weaker stones.]B[bd]
;C[\(18\) Extending white's liberties, keeping it hard to capture.]W[bc]
;C[\(19\) The empty triangle may look bad, but Black must reduce White's liberties.]B[cd]
;C[\(20-E14\) White cannot capture the black stones, but he strengthens his own stones to get thickness on the outside.]W[ef]
;C[\(21-D18\) Completes the capture of the corner.]B[db]
;C[\(22-G17\) Completes white's outside influence. White can play at G18 or D14 in sente, but not both. White will wait to see which way to play. On the other hand, if black pushes at G18, or D14, then white is happy to build more influence on the outside. So this corner is more or less settled for now. Black has profit, and white has influence.]W[gc]
;C[\(23-N17\) In the upper left, Black has captured 12 points, while White has gained outside influence \(thickness\).  \(The 12 points may increase before the end of the game, but now the increase is too small to worry about.\)  Because the initial moves were all aimed at large-scale play, White's thickness will have a considerable effect, and I judge White to be ahead.  If I had it to do over, I would play either move 7 or 9 at K16. 

The future play will be a contest to determine the exact value of White's thickness.  The value of thickness is largely determined by the presence or absence of weak, attackable groups.  If Black plays too close to the upper left, say at K16, White will start a vigourous attack \(N16 is a possible move\), and will be able to take a lot of territory while Black is busy defending.  On the other hand, If Black ignores the upper side and plays at Q5 or some such point, White will play around O16 and Black will have no choice but to invade White's framework \(moyo\) -- producing a weak group. 

\[One reader suggested a play on the fourth line at N16, rather than N17.  That is at least as good.  J.\]]B[mc]
;C[\(24-N4\) Threatens to play at Q5, enclosing black's corner. If black answers in the corner, then white can consider it a forcing move. However, it does give black a lot of territory. On the other hand, black's aim was not to enclose the corner, and if white does not play here, then black may play at M4, enclosing the corner on a large scale \(or inviting white to invade and be attacked.\)]W[mp]
;C[\(25-G5\) Because White's moyo is larger than Black's, Black will lose in a simple territory-surrounding contest.  The proper point of reduction or invasion is a difficult problem, and I have no confidence that my play is correct.  The aim of G5 is to limit White's territory while building some Black thickness.  But White may counterattack, and a major fight will result.]B[go]
;C[\(26-E5\) Answering underneath would be too submissive, so white responds at E5. Playing at D6 would not put enough pressure on black.]W[eo]
;C[\(27-G7\) Black runs for safety.  The center area is more important than anything Black can do on the lower side.]B[gm]
;C[\(28-E8\) White attacks black while taking territory. Playing at E7 is also possible. E8 is thinner but faster. If white does not play around here, black can make eyespace while reducing the left side.]W[el]
;C[\(29-G9\) "A one-point jump is never wrong."  Go sure is an easy game, isn't it? ;-\)]B[gk]
;C[\(30-H8\) A forcing move to make black heavy.]W[hl]
;C[\(31-G8\) I considered various moves to resist White's forcing move, such as F7, F8, F9, E7, E9, etc., but they strengthen White more then Black.  The simple connection leaves White's weaknesses intact. ]B[gl]
;C[\(32-H6\) Another forcing move.]W[hn]
;C[\(33-G6\) Again, Black lets himself be pushed around, awaiting his chance to counterattack.]B[gn]
;C[\(34-E9\) Protects against the attachment at E7 or E9 \(probably followed by a white hane underneath, then a black cross-cut\).]W[ek]
;C[\(35-J8\) The clamp \(hasami-tsuke\) is a remarkably effective way to strengthen one's stones.  Sometimes it becomes a sacrifice to make eye shape, but in this position, White cannot even disconnect the stone. 

I was tempted to ignore the center and play on the right side. However, my 5 stones in the center would then come under severe attack.  The strength White gained in the attack would permit him to effectively destroy any area I had built up on the right.  Black strength in the center does more to affect the right side than any single move along the side itself.  It also limits White's upper side.]B[il]
;C[\(36-D14\) White seals off the left side in sente, to get the maximum amount of territory.]W[df]
;C[\(37-B18\) Black cannot escape the blockade.  Black can reduce white's territory a little by playing moves such as C14, but he will still end up in gote, and white will still have sente moves on the upper side. Further, white will become stronger on the lower side.  It is difficult to decide whether reducing white's territory a bit more is worth these disadvantages.]B[bb]
;C[\(38-B15\) Finishes sealing off the upper side.]W[be]
;C[\(39-A17\) Black must continue to play submissively -- further evidence of the effectiveness of White's sacrifice of 3 stones.]B[ac]
;C[\(40-K8\) Sacrificing the forcing stones. I considered playing in the lower right corner, but the problem is that black may be able to form a large moyo in the upper right.  Similarly, playing in the upper right allows black to make territory along the right while attacking. It seems preferable to continue attacking the black stones to build up some thickness. Black cannot take all the territory on the right with one move anyway.]W[jl]
;C[\(41-J9\) I would have preferred to fight back with K7 or K9, but I couldn't find a good variation.]B[ik]
;C[\(42-R14\) Time to do something about black's right side. Other possibilities are Q-5, and the cap at P-9. ]W[qf]
;C[\(43-R16\) Prevents White from getting a base in the corner.  Either R15 or S15 would be a stronger attack, but leave more weaknesses in the corner.]B[qd]
;C[\(44-R11\) Makes some eyespace for white.]W[qi]
;C[\(45-Q5\) Enclosing the corner does not definitely surround the side, but while White has unsettled stones above as well as to the left, he will find it dangerous to invade.  If White were allowed to play here, the Black stones would be the ones under attack.]B[po]
;C[\(46-P11\) White reinforces his weakest group. Although the group cannot be killed, if black attacks it he will have the initiative.]W[oi]
;C[\(47-N2\) Undercutting the eye space of White's group.  I cannot get much direct territory by attacking in this area, but I hope to solidify the lower right side and, if things go well, build strength for an attack on the upper White group.  Then I can build territory on the upper side and center.]B[mr]
;C[\(48-R7\) White needs to start a fight. This will make things more confused, and hopefully in the confusion, the issue will be thrown in doubt.]W[qm]
;C[\(49-Q8\) Simultaneously running for safety and attacking White.  A play at P9 would allow White to connect with S9.]B[pl]
;C[\(50-R4\) The vital point of this shape.]W[qp]
;C[\(51-Q4\) If BR5, WQ4, BP4, WR3, White will live in the corner.  Since White will live no matter what, Black tries to become as strong as possible on the outside, by eliminating any cutting points.]B[pp]
;C[\(52-R3\) Going into the corner to make shape. Unfortunately, black has responded calmly to white's invasion, building thickness. White's overall thinness is becoming apparent, and I think black has a clear lead now.  \[That's nice to hear, but I don't think the situation so clear.  J.B.\]]W[qq]

;C[\(63-J3\) Now that Black is strong on the right, White will find it difficult here.  I probably won't be able to capture the White stones, but I expect to surround some territory on the lower side and a larger portion on the upper side and center as a by-product of this attack.]B[iq]
;C[\(64-K6\) Connecting his stones, trying to make some eye shape.

Although many feel that the invasion of the right corner was bad, actually the situation for white was unfavorable before this. When black played at N2, he was essentially starting the large endgame. I did not think I could win the yose, so I decided to try something different.]W[jn]
;C[\(65-K9\) The key point in the center.  It builds black thickness, while keeping White surrounded and separated.]B[jk]
;C[\(66-H4\) Black's last move and a play around here are a little like miai.]W[hp]
;C[\(67-C3\) A probe to test White's reaction.]B[cq]
;C[\(68-C4\) White should block on the other side, keeping black's stones separated. However, then the territories would not be close enough for white to win.]W[cp]
;C[\(69-K3\) Saving the stone removes a potential eye for White, while taking some territory.]B[jq]
;C[\(70-H3\) Harrassing the 2 Black stones, while threatening to connect to the left side.]W[hq]

;C[\(73-L4\) Cuts off the stone at N4.]B[kp]
;C[\(74-K5\) Connects the stone in atari.]W[jo]
;C[\(75-M4\) Black must not be too greedy, because of the cutting point at
L3.  As just one example, if BM5, WM6, BN6, WL3, Black must give up
something.  On the other hand, connecting at L3 will become redundant
if Black later surrounds territory.  \[On second thought, see move 77.\]]B[lp]
;C[\(76-M6\) A reducing move.]W[ln]
;C[\(77-N5\) Black has too many cutting points to counterattack.  I now wish I had played 75 at L3, in which case I would now cut off White's connection to the left rather than defending myself.  My original reasoning was that Black M4 is the diagram is better placed than a stone at L3 would be.  But if L3 prevents White M6, that is better yet.]B[mo]
;C[\(78-D3\) Takes the corner and firms up white's connection.]W[dq]
;C[\(79-P14\) Following the exchange on the lower side, Black is about 15-20 points behind in territory, including the komi.  I hope to make up the difference while keeping White busy defending his weak group.]B[of]
;C[\(80-N11\) I don't think Black is behind. In any case, White must defend his group. Jumping out applies a little pressure to the black group, but leaves behind the potential for black to make some profit on the right.]W[mi]
;C[\(81-Q12\) I gave serious consideration to L11, to strengthen my center group while encircling White.  But White would then defend at Q13 or some such point, and be safe.  His overall thickness \(strength\) should then give him the win.  Hence I go for some profit on the right, and will worry about the center later.  \(If White had played at Q13 instead of N11, I would have been satisfied to play at N11 myself, and try for some center or upper-side territory.\) 
We are both playing somewhat riskily here, based on our estimations of the prospects.  Regardless of one's evaluation of the chances, the position is a critical one, and the outcome is quite unclear.]B[ph]
;C[\(82-Q11\) Without the stone at Q8, white would normally resist by playing at R12. However, in this case black would play at Q11, then white Q10, then  black P12, making miai of cutting at R10 or P10. Without the black stone at Q8, white could connect at R10 and then capture a cutting stone at P10. 

White might also consider resisting at R10, but the black stones Around R9 are too solid for this to have much effect on black. 

Another option is to just attack the black group, but that would leave behind the aji of the cut, so white would have a hard time trying to make enough profit to compensate for the cut.]W[pi]
;C[\(83-S12\) If Black cuts with R12, white S12, black S13, white S11, black R13, he gets very bad shape.  After S12, black still gets some profit while white's group remains unsettled.]B[rh]
;C[\(84-R12\) To connect up his stones.]W[qh]
;C[\(85-S13\) Continuing to undercut White's eye space.]B[rg]
;C[\(86-N6\)  A forcing move. This also helps white's group indirectly; however, black may ignore the forcing move. Connecting at R13 is a big move, but may be gote.]W[mn]
;C[\(87-O10\) If Black answers N6, White gets something for nothing. This way, White gets more, but at the cost of a move.]B[nj]
;C[\(88-N10\) We're both resisting each other's forcing moves and leaving things hanging.]W[mj]
;C[\(89-N9\) If black cuts with O11, WO12, BN12, then White will give up his 5 stones on the right and build thickness in the center.  Then the game would depend on whether Black could save his center stones.  I don't think it's a good bet.  N9 aims to keep the entire White group surrounded and weak, so that Black's center group is relatively stronger.]B[mk]
;C[\(90-M9\) Since white has resisted the peep, he must hane here to be consistent.]W[lk]
;C[\(91-M8\) Blocking White's connection.]B[ll]
;C[\(92-L8\) Blocking Black, in turn.]W[kl]
;C[\(93-L9\) Black must cut.]B[kk]
;C[\(94-M10\) White must connect.]W[lj]
;C[\(95-O8\) Now both sides have a group floating without eyes.  But it's White's move, so he has the advantage in the fight.]B[nl]
;C[\(96-L12\) White must attack before connecting \(around O11\) If white connects first, then his whole group will come under attack. If white attacks black first instead, then he may have time to connect later, and the pressure will be on black instead of vice versa. 

If black can find time to cut and still live, white will lose.]W[kh]
;C[\(97-K12\) An attachment usually strengthens both sides.  In the current position, Black's center group is weaker than White's, because White's position on the upper left is stronger than Black's on the upper right.  Hence mutual strengthening can be expected to favor Black.]B[jh]
;C[\(98-K13\) White has to hane, even though this strengthens black.]W[jg]
;C[\(99-L13\) If Black simply allows himself to be pushed to the left \(i.e., plays at J12 or J13\), White will surround him and make enough territory to win even if Black makes two eyes.  The cut creates a more-or-less even fight.]B[kg]
;C[\(100-M12\) A usual move in a cutting fight -- extend the cutting stone. Even if white didn't extend, the stone cannot be cut off, but this would give black too many options.]W[lh]
;C[\(101-L14\) Also strengthening a cutting stone.  This helps Black's center group indirectly, by threatening White's group and also the stone at K13.   If both big groups live, then L14 will be an important territorial point.  And I don't think White can kill my group....]B[kf]
;C[\(102-K11\) Whatever happens, white must give atari here and try to push through. Letting black connect here would make things too easy.]W[ji]
;B[ih]
;C[\(104-J11\) Keeping black separated.]W[ii]
;C[\(105-H11\) My position will be cut no matter what I do, so I attempt to prevent White from connecting to the left.]B[hi]
;C[\(106-H12\) Continuing to cut.]W[hh]
;C[\(107-J13\) Preserving the cutting stones.]B[ig]
;C[\(108-H10\) Cutting....]W[hj]
;C[\(109-G11\) Resisting....]B[gi]
;C[\(110-G10\) Cutting....]W[gj]
;C[\(111-L11\) The only move to prevent White from connecting his main group.  I'm not sure if it works; I have read only far enough to be confident that no other move is better that resigning.  \(F10 has perhaps the most interesting refutation.\)  If I lose the fight, move 101-L14 was perhaps the fatal mistake -- J12 would have been much safer.]B[ki]
;C[\(112-F11\) Captures the stones at H11 and G11 in a ladder. Jonathan's comment about F10 probably refers to the fact that a stone at F10 does not break the ladder, because white can squeeze, giving up F11, and keep on laddering.]W[fi]
;C[\(113-L10\) Now both sides have a group that is without eyes.  One of them will die.]B[kj]
;C[\(114-O9\) White cannot play at H9 yet, because of not enough liberties. This connection increases his liberties.]W[ni]
;C[\(115-H9\) Likewise, Black increases his liberties.]B[hk]
;C[\(116-G12\) Threatens to pull out K13.

Black resigns.  If Black K14, then White R13 puts White one liberty ahead.

Incidentally, as an overall comment on the game, black was ahead for almost the entire game.  Jonathan made a slip near the end (he commented that the move might be the losing move) which indeed it was.  White was lucky to win the game.

Another comment is that the joseki in the top left corner is not really a joseki, because of the distance of white's pincer. I think Jonathan could have counterattacked and ended up with a favorable result for black.]W[gh]

;B[pp]C[Landman: Poka actually considers this to be the best pro move.  It 
has also seen C16 and Q16 in this context.]
(
;W[pd]C[Landman: Poka thinks Q15 is better.  One way of looking at this 
might be, that after Q16 there is only one big corner move left \(at C16\), 
which Black gets. After 4.Q15, there are two such moves left, and so White 
is guaranteed a shimari.]
(
;B[jp]C[Maas: San ren sei, rather popular lately. I would have approached 
the white stone on the 4-5 point instead, but at this stage as Lance Kemper 
said "anything works". This doesn't mean you can play at random, but nearly 
any standard move is compatible with some possible game plan and only a few 
points worse than the "best" move, quite playable in amateur games.

Peter Kim: This is only true if you are willing to aid white in building 
his moyo with moves e16 \(a high influence and center oriented move\) and 
q16 \(again a move good for working toward a moyo\), but from further moves 
is appears that white has gone for a more territorial game. White still has 
the potential for a moyo, but it seems less likely now.

Landman: Against 4.Q15, Poka thinks this is the best move. Since the upper 
corners are miai, that seems reasonable. But against 4.Q16 Black should 
invade immediately at 5.C16. A reasonable continuation would be White at 
6.D14 to build central influence \(both to work with the Q16 stone, and to 
begin to counter the Black nirensei\). At any rate, the focus of the game 
would then be the upper left for a while.]
(
;W[kc]C[Maas: I would have made an enclosure in the upper left corner, but 
again at this stage "anything works". Shawe-Shiuan Wang 
<wangs@sol.engr.umbc.edu> says this move is bad, see black's good reply at 
Q10 which black missed in the game.

Peter Kim: I think that enclosing the upper left corner is premature, and 
by playing as high as white did,  white doesn't appear to want the corner 
too urgently. L17 works better with what white has already established, a 
flexible fuseki for territory or moyo.  I think c16 \(or something like\)
lacks tempo at this point.  Black has taken a big point of potential,  white 
should answer with the same.

rON: I was shocked to see white \(Chris\) opening up so passivly.  Black 
opened with a standard 4-4 to san-ren-sai on the lower side; very quiet and 
non-offensive. White opened up quiet as well; I think white would have been 
a bit better off starting at d15 instead of e16 for a 5-4 opening, because I 
feel it better faces the 4-4 pointing into the center that black opened up 
with.

Char: Thumbs down: Black seems to be expanding faster than white.

Doug: Thumbs up: White's moves are balanced both territorrialy and 
influentially.

Jos: Personally I would not play this at all. You give black a chance to 
attack your left upper corner to prevent your shimari. Imagine the sequence 
B:e16, W:e17, B:f17, W:d17, B:f14 and black starts having magnificent 
influence. So you should answer something like g17 or g16, but whites 
position looks already a little cramped. During the following moves neither 
side seems to consider the shimari \(white at e16\) very big. In my eyes 
that is a big mistake!

Xiang-Ming Liu: I would attack the lower right corner. I think if white 
wants to counterbalance black's moyo, L16 is better.

Landman: Out of Poka's opening book. To me, this seems a little tight. It's 
like a low Chinese shrunk by two spaces.  Surely the shimari at C16 is 
bigger. However, Poka's \(19 kyu\) algorithm likes this move a lot.  Almost 
as much as K11 ... :->]
(
;B[dj]C[rON: Black went passive again by playing the 'big point' on the 
left, giving white the 'big point' on the right.

Char: Thumbs up: Good stategic move following San-ren-sei opening.

Doug: Thumbs down: Gote. An approach move would be better.

Jos: If not at e16, than the right hand side is far superior now. White has 
no good extension on the left side as long as his corner stone is still this 
open. So one possibility is r14. If W:o16 you play at Q10 and are in 
magnificent shape. White cannot play like this. His stone at L17 looks an 
itsy bit overconcentrated already. Alternative: W:q11, B:r17 and white has 
to choose between q17 and r16. I prefer the black position.

Shawe-Shiuan Wang: I would choose Q10. Following are the moves I expect:
7-Q10, 8-D10, 9-R14,  10-O16, 11-C16, 12-D14. Because ladder \(C14, C13\) is 
good for black and black's territory is larger than white's. I think black 
is better. \(Hence, 6 L-17 may not be a good move.\)]
(
;W[qj]C[Maas: Ain't seen no action yet ... Peter Kim: With black playing san 
ren sei it looks like both parties are capable of working for a moyo, but 
white looks a bit more like he's working toward territory on the edge, but 
he's flexible enough to still go for a moyo. \(I like white's position 
slightly better\)

Char and Doug: 2 Thumbs Down: Gote. White should take the initiative.

Xiangming Liu: Still, if you want to build a moyo, Q10 is better.]
(
;B[qm]C[Maas: This move looks bad now that I think about it later. White's 
stone is low, so this move doesn't threaten to undermine it. It's on the 
third line, so it doesn't threaten to cap the white stone. It's two-skips 
away, so it doesn't threaten to squeeze much. The center, or a kakari 
\(approach enemy corner\) might have been better. Wang agrees and says he'd 
pick the kakari at C16.

Peter Kim: This may have been better at k10.  Black after white's k10 is 
going to have a much hard time refuting white's moyo, AND prevent white 
getting enough center influence to attack black's potential territory.  also 
after white k10 black does not have a good move, as seen in moves 11-13.

rON: Black loses some of his advantage by playing r07. It, too, is passive, 
and doesn't really face anything in particular. White jumps on the 
opportunity to take a very large point right in the center.

Char: Thumbs down: Counters the strategy behind San-ren-sei and doesn't 
really guard the corner.

Doug: Thumbs down: What does this stone do?

Jos: e16 is still superior.

Shawe-Shiuan Wang: I would choose C16. I don't think R7 is the biggest move 
because there is white stone is on R10 but not Q10.

Xiangming Liu: 9-R7 is not as important as K10.

Michael: I now think this is way too slow for what I want to do in this 
game. As numerous netpeople pointed out, playing low like this makes a 
mockery of my hitherto high strategy.]
(
;W[jj]C[Maas: I was sort of expecting that at some point somebody would play 
in the center to stake out a large moyo \(territorial framework\). White has 
now done so. Now the burden is on black to prevent white from turning most 
of it into territory, by reducing and/or invading sooner or later. It should 
be easy for black to reduce the moyo, but if he waits too long it may indeed 
turn into white territory. The theme of this game is now set. Wang would 
pick C16 enclosing the corner instead.

White: Tengen I win!!! There is one of those sayings floating around the 
local go club: "the first one to tengen wins" :-\)

Jos: You don't make territory that easily. Look at some pro-games and see 
how much territory they really get out of such a moyo.

rON: This point \(White K10\) is important, especially in this game, 
because both players have designated that they want to play a 
center-oriented game \(3 4-4 points and the 5-4, all four opening moves are 
center oriented openings\). This point will serve white very well later on 
when he \(white\) starts attacking.

Doug: Thumbs level: This has a shin-fuseki feel. Will white know how to use 
it?

Char: Thumbs down: I think now is the time to attack. I like the move at 
O3.

Shawe-Shiuan Wang: I would choose C16.]
(
;B[df]C[Shawe-Shiuan Wang <wangs@sol.engr.umbc.edu> would pick D13 instead. 
See the bad shape that results after this D14 and black's next move. Maas 
agrees, simply make a two-skip jump to D13 then black wouldn't have to make 
another move here after white replies, so black would get sente and good 
shape.

Player: I preferred to approach the corner because I wanted to keep an 
outside 'feel' to my game. I didn't want to lose my stone behind a white 
wall if I invade at the 3-4 point.

Peter Kim: 11-d14 is about the only move black can make at this point for 
an attack. If black goes for the corner. White can seal black in and 
increase his influence toward the center. Something white appears to have 
been willing to do from the begining, since he player the 4-5 point. If 
black plays on the upper right side of the 4-5 point, white can build a 
loose wall on BOTH sides of black. Again this would improve white's moyo on 
the right, make taking the upper left corner easier for white to "put in the 
bank", and leave black with a vulnerable group on the board.

Char and Doug: 2 Thumbs Down: What does this move hope to accomplish?

Jos: 11-d14 is really bad. Now you force white to take the important point.

Shawe-Shiuan Wang: How about D13? these three 3 black stones 
\(D10,D14,F14\) are not in good shape.]
;W[cd]C[Char and Doug: 2 Thumbs up: Good response. A move white wanted to 
make anyway, and black induced him to make it.]
;B[ff]C[Maas: Next, white can either try to turn the center into territory 
by blocking black's advance, or invade somewhere in the lower leftside or 
along the bottom. White won't be able to actually turn much into territory, 
but threatening to do so will constrain black's options. Note also the 
inefficient shape of black's stones at D10 D14 and F14, pointed out by 
Shawe-Shiuan Wang <wangs@sol.engr.umbc.edu>.

Jos: ... there is no territory, just influence. And one of the rules about 
influence is that if you try to convert it directly into territory you get 
too little. You can only turn influence profitably into territory if you 
have something that can keep the opponent busy, like while you attack a 
group. That can give you a chance to seal off one side without him being 
able to come in from the other side. As it is, black can build several 
living groups insides whites sphere of influence. So the focus will turn now 
to how white should use his stone at k10. It is a little bit far away from 
his other stones on the upper and right side, because both are on the third 
line.

Peter Kim: Once white has taken the 3-4 point black again is forced to play 
f14 anything else will allow white to either make weak black groups on the 
board, or convert even more of white's potential in to territory. \(Similar 
reasoning to 11-d14\) The problem \(that began with white's move at k10\) is 
made worse now that white has sente.   B14 for white is really good here for 
white since it is urgent for black to answer here, but has no good way to 
strengthen his two stones well and regain sente. White can then commence an 
attack on black's moyo or territory, especially if white utilizes k10.

rON: The passive opening by black allows white to draw black into whatever 
type of game white wanted to play. White could have just as easily elected 
to play the 'big-moyo' type game, or the lets get down and fight type game, 
or anything in-between. White is going to chose the fighting game.  
Passivity in the opening will allow your opponent to draw you into their 
type of game, which is something you don't want.

Char and Doug: Thumbs level: We must wait and see how this will be used.

Jos: 13-f14 seems fine to me. But now you are running after white. He has 
gotten the initiative. Just because you refused to take the good point and 
let him take k10 too. He should never get both points.]
(
;W[hc]C[Maas: Hmmm, white takes top-side territory instead of protecting the 
center moyo.

Michael: I was happy with how slow this move appears to be, \(although it 
does look nice and solid\).

Lee Schumacher: White 14 seems inconsistent with the influence oriented 
plays he made previously. If you're going to play on the side, G16 is the 
spot.

*** Possible erratum: Another record of the game shows G17 instead of H17
for that move. Which is correct?]
;B[qf]C[Maas: Black invades the side first. If he maintains sente he can go 
back to reduce the center moyo from the left. Lee Schumacher suggests 
capping at P10 \(presumably in sente\), followed by the 3-3 invasion at R17.]
(
;W[qh]C[Maas: White's stone on the right was getting weak, so white combined 
an extension and a pincer. But now black can obliterate the center moyo \(if 
he's careful not to get killed or in bad danger\).]
;B[of];W[nd];B[rd]
;W[qc]C[End of main branch as of 1991.Oct.24 13 PDT. Maas: Next black might 
separate the center stone from the right-side group while simultaneously 
strengthening his weak upper right-side group.]
(
;B[ph]C[Michael: I think this move may be too much of a contact move. Still, 
my eventual shape is quite nice. Maas: Indeed. This only strengthens the 
two-stone white group. Avoid contact plays to a group if you want to attack 
it eventually. Lee Schumacher agrees: N14 is probably the move here.]
;W[pi];B[qg]
(
;W[rh]C[Maas: Watch this sequence, a case of "the stones go a walking" \(as 
in the book 'Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go'\)]
;B[oh]
(
;W[oi]C[Lee Schumacher: This is wrong, pushing from behind + giving black 
the hane at the head of 2 stones.  O 10 is better shape. Maas: I missed 
that. Now that you've shown me that, I agree.]
;B[ni]
(
;W[nh]C[Maas: I don't like that cut. Why not just hane underneath instead?
Isn't that the way the stones walk? \(Schumacher answers that white's hane 
would be locally bad shape due to black's double hane reply, but playable 
for white.\) With this cut, white is just asking black to atari then extend 
downward from O11 and cut white in two. The group on the edge will have to 
get two eyes before playing elsewhere, and then black will be able to put 
pressure on the center white stone.]
(
;B[ng]C[Lee Schumacher: the proverb says to extend from a cross cut, but 
with white strong on the upper side this would leave black's group in the 
lurch. Thus 29 is the correct side, but the wrong move.  The problem as 
black soon discovers is that his cutting stone is weakened by white's 
response. I would recommend N14 - the one space jump is never wrong \(since 
we're 
going with proverbs\).  Sure white can mangle your eye shape 
with the atari at P13, but in the process he limits his own liberties, and 
your group is still escaping into the middle.  Plus, none of this affects 
the all important cutting stone. Maas: I've included his complete remark 
above because it seems to make sense. See the variation I concocted based on 
the reccommended move.]
;W[mh]
(
;B[mg]C[Maas: Now black is asking for his cutting stone \(originally a 
hane\) to be captured. In return his upper group is a bit more in the open. 
I don't like this move for black. If black had extended downward and white 
hane'd, black could counter-hane and have nice shape.]
;W[mj]C[Maas: Good for white. If you can capture a cutting stone, you should 
do it immediately. It's not actually captured completely, but trying to 
escape immediately would be strategically bad, allowing white to enlarge his 
surrounding groups in sente. Assuming black plays elsewhere, perhaps shortly 
White can play somewhere below there, where the black moyo is reduced 
simultaneously with really capturing the stone?]
;B[lh]C[Maas: Aji keshi, i.e. throwing away your options for later play. Now 
the stone will be in atari, and black has lost options of peeking from two 
directions if he needs extra stones in the vicinity later. Black should just 
tenuki now instead of forcing the sequence. Schumacher points out that since 
the black stone wasn't completely captured, this forcing play also has the 
disadvantage of losing the potential of saving the stone later. He 
continues: Abandoning the cutting stone makes white very thick in the 
center.  This has a big impact black's prospects for making territory on the 
lower side.]
;W[mi]
(
;B[kf]C[Maas: Too tight and not urgent. If black tenukis instead, and white 
cuts, black ataris \(sacrificing the stone that was cut off\) and black is 
nicely connected to the left at minimal cost. If the cut-off stone were an 
important cutting stone, then keeping it alive would be urgent. It isn't 
here. Because the white group already has two eyes and is connected, if 
black lets it capture another stone or two and get slightly bigger and more 
eyes it's no big deal.]
;W[cn]C[Michael: Here I have lost the initiative and will just have to hope 
that I can get it back eventually. Maas: Because of black making that 
unnecessary move, white now gets to play where black should have played. 
Black's previous move would have made a big difference if used here instead 
of the upper-center. Note because of black letting white capture the stone 
at O11, the white stones from K10 to S12 are connected and have two eyes 
already, so it's completely safe for white to venture an invasion at this 
time.]
;B[cl];W[en];B[fp]
;W[gn]C[Maas: Is that really the best move for white? What about sliding 
toward the corner, then a contact play against C8 to get the white invading 
group settled? Lee Schumacher answers: I believe this is correct. Compare 
having a black stone there. I think white has an excellent game - solid 
territory on the upper side, lots of central power, and no weak groups. \(In 
this case, 3 dan does make a difference.\)]
;B[hp]C[End of main line as of 1991.Oct.31 23. Maas: Gee, that was fun 
finding so much fault with the stone-walking in upper right center. At this 
stage of the game, there is often exactly one reasonable move, and all other 
moves are mistakes. \(If I could know that best move in my own games I'd be 
3 dan :-\)]
;W[nq]
(
;B[pq]C[Maas: This closes off the corner solidly so there's no tricky stuff 
later, but it doesn't put quite as much direct pressure on the invading 
stone as the standard move at P3. I would have played P3 myself.]
;W[kr]C[Maas: In my humble opinion, this large-knight's move is possible 
only because black didn't make the contact play but made the looser move 
instead. \(Do the 3-dans agree white is getting more this way than the 
standard way?\)]
(
;B[ir]C[Maas: I don't approve of this move either. I would have made the 
contact play at L3, forcing white to decide whether to connect and be 
blocked solidly on the left, or extend to the left and be cut in two. Again 
I'm on shakey ground and solicit advice of the 3-dans.]
;W[bp]C[Maas: White slides, probably believing it's sente, but what if Black 
attacks the two white stones instead of answering the slide?]
(
;B[cq]
;W[or]C[Maas: White has been allowed to settle his group in sente \(black 
must now make another move to prevent white from jumping into the corner\). 
If black didn't have the corner so solidly closed off, i.e. if he had 
invested less in the center earlier, a threat to jump in wouldn't be such 
definite sente. Next white will be able to enlarge his group or invade the 
upper left-side, his choice.]
;B[pr]
;W[bf]C[Maas: White is ahead by about 10 points, 15 if we add komi, so white 
slides into the open upper left-side instead of invading, the less dangerous 
method. \(Proverb: "Rich men don't pick fights."\) After black answers, 
white can reduce from the top and black will have very little territory in 
that part of the board. I predict a win by white if he doesn't blunder 
later.]
;B[cg]
;W[lp]C[Maas: White decided to avoid trouble and take his bottom-side group 
completely out of danger. Black now has sente and may be able to catch up a 
little...]
;B[pk]C[Maas: Black threatens to save his cutting stone. Nearly any reply by 
white in this part of board will reduce black's liberties just enough to 
re-capture the stone. Which is strategically best?? \(This is an open-ended 
question for the 3-dans.\)]
(
;W[qk]C[Maas: This is more complicated than simply playing at P9, but takes 
profit on the edge. Being ahead, perhaps white should have made a tighter 
move that avoided complications. Let's see if white can avoid making a 
blunder here... <<End of main line as of 1991.Nov.06 19 PST -- We gotta wait 
until the next installment to find out how this cliffhanger is resolved.>>]
(
;B[pl]C[Maas: This is the simplest way to play. Now white must capture the 
cutting stone immediately.]
(
;W[nj]C[Maas: Well, you don't actually have to take it off the board. 
Playing one spot lower would have captured it too, and given more center 
influence. I'm not sure which way is best.]
;B[no]C[Black uses sente to nearly surround the lower group. It would be 
painful to be cut off and be forced to make two eyes locally, so white is 
forced to run the gauntlet to the center to connect to his stronger group. 
White can either single-skip or play diagonal. Which is best?]
(
;W[kp]C[Player: Sorry it took so long I wanted to consider the postion for a 
while. Maas: White makes shape locally. I wouldn't play that way. What if 
Black extends directly upward, making it difficult for white to connect 
through the narrows? After white lives on the bottom, Black will then have 
thickness in the center and be able to split the other two groups, putting 
the lower-leftside group into some danger. By attacking first one group then 
another, black will build up strength in the center, and eventually have 
enough stones in place to shift the balance of territory in the center 
towards black's favor.]
;B[jo]C[Player: Don't worry about the delay; I was more worried that it 
might have been  my turn :-\) I just had a look at rec.games.go; absolutely 
full of messages broadcasting our  names worldwide.. I'm all shy now  :-\)
Maas: Good for black, the move I suggested as best.]
;W[ln]
;B[im]C[Maas: White threatens to completely settle himself. As a result he 
partly settles himself in sente.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[cp]
;B[dq]C[End of main branch as of 1991.Nov.15 07. White needs to finish 
settling his lower-leftside group before it gets attacked too heavily. Black 
will then probably have sente to stake out some territory in the center. 
\(The attacking-groups part of the middle game will be over, and we'll be in 
what some call the "late middlegame" and others call the "macro endgame"
where staking out actual territory takes place.\) I estimate about 42 points 
for Black plus whatever he makes in the center, 56 for white \(plus 5.5
komi?\), so Black needs to make 20 points in the center to win \(15 if not 
using komi\). I think Black should be able to make just about that much, so 
the game should be very close.]
;W[bm]C[Maas: White's lower-leftside group now looks basically alive. Black 
can peek at White's cutting points to build up a center wall in sente. Let's 
see how much territory he can get...]
(
;B[he]C[Maas: Black's move wasn't sente, so I don't approve of it. Now White 
has a chance to destroy most of the potential center territory.]
(
;W[hd]C[Maas: I don't think White needed to play here. Sure black could 
break through a little bit into the side, but since white is totally alive 
on both sides this was worth only maybe five or so points. White should have 
reduced the potential center territory instead. \(What do the 3-dans 
think?\)]
(
;B[bl]C[Maas: If this were sente against the lower-leftside white group, 
then he could play at B13 next to close off the left side, worth about 8
points in gote. Still not as big as the center moyo. I disapprove.]
(
;W[do]C[Maas: White thought Black's move was sente; he answered it. If I 
were white, I would have played at A2 in sente first, then here.]
;B[fm]C[Maas: Note that now after the B8-D5 exchange, D7 would no longer be 
sente, so black doesn't get as much of a wall as he might have. On the other 
hand, the left side is half closed now, probably an equal exchange.]
(
;W[bo]C[Maas: I thought white was already alive, but maybe I was mistaken??
Now white's stone at G6 is "en prie", giving black half a chance on about 7
extra points.]
(
;B[gj]C[Maas: Black begins to close off the center territory. But I would 
prefer a more forceful sequence.]
(
;W[bg]C[Maas: Why not jump right in one spot lower? Is the upper-left corner 
really weak enough to warrant an ultra-conservative move here? -- End of 
main branch as 1991.Nov.25. The center is bigger than the left side, so I 
think black should play there instead of answering White's last move, but 
we'll have to wait to see what happens ...]
(
;B[bh]
;W[hi]C[Maas: Because black made the last move on the side, white was able 
to play here and greatly reduce black's center. Or is this an overplay?]
(
;B[gi]C[Maas: Black blocks passively, letting white have his apparent 
overplay.]
;W[rl]
;B[ld]C[Maas: This move is more forcing \(a bigger threat\) than white's 
previous move, so black can interpose it before answering white's move.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[mc]
(
;B[ne]C[Maas: This move, on the other hand, is not such a big threat. White 
can tenuki to make a big gain elsewhere, then fall back and regroup after 
black atari's here. I would call this move a mistake in timing.]
(
;W[oe]C[Maas: What, white answered it? He has given black back his bad move.]
(
;B[pe]C[Maas: Again black makes a small move that doesn't have to be 
answered if white has a big move elsewhere instead.]

too good to allow you to play in this region. I hope so. :-\)  Maas: Finally 
black makes the correct move.]
(
;W[me]C[Player: I think it was only 5 points. I just could not see a way to 
exploit it very well at all. I'm not sure though I imagine that someone will 
comment on it.  Maas: This is about 5 points in gote, probably too small to 
play yet, and strengthens black too. I would play elsewhere at this time.]

think the sequence we are about to play is probably fairly forced. -- End of 
main branch as of 1991.Dec.05 -- Maas: White has already suffered a loss 
without compensation if he tenukis now, so presumably he'll finish the gote

captured, it's small, so black could easily switch to a bigger point 
elsewhere.]

 Maaniker 9k: no, no l1
 mike NR: i bet r17
 kobayashi 9p: Some background information:
 zhong NR: what the heck. i guess o17
 zhuge NR: i agree, o17.

 jjs NR: what is I Y 's name in Chinese?
 kobayashi 9p: TV commentator: Kiyonari, 9p

 AlexG NR: will we see his comments?
 kompella 7k: Why a referee for 9dan pros?
 godok 1k: it is an honor to be a referee, i guess
 zhuge NR: oh well, referee is always needed.
 kobayashi 9p: Takagi will only comment tomorrow evening
 phd NR: so in case the voliator does not agree, two 9p can show him some color
 godok 1k: next move will take long time....
 JW NR: in case that... :)
 zhuge NR: wow! (too bad i failed to reach Jiang)
 ajiko NR: Takagi played Otake in the final of the lightning tournament in S.F.

 phd NR: so i guess the remaining 9p is Yan Ben Xuen?
 mike NR: thanks zhuge
 JW NR: xiao lin guang yi and da zhu ying xiong are the two, mike.
 mike NR: wow  these are two of my favorite!
 zhuge NR: i think phd is right.
 jonathan 8k: how about a bit of commentary to liven things up a bit? anyone?
 phd NR: Yan Ben is old. I saw his game with Wu Qing-yan
 zhong NR: iwamoto is the 9p phd mentioned
 jjs NR: which will be b's move if w o17 ? k16?
 tsand 2k: nothing much to say, i suppose
 ajiko NR: I concur whole-heartedly, yes.
 zhuge NR: sure!  so far the openning is the same as the one between kolian and me. :)
 jjs NR: what if w l3?
 willfor 8k: why are they thinking for so long already? They must have seen this exactly this position many times before.
 kolian 4k: zhuge: But we don't get bucks for it huh?
 mike NR: i have just talked to  da zu ying xiong on igs!!! :)
 Maaniker 9k: they are not thinking the are discussing yesterdays party
 AlexG NR: They can't decide between o17 and l3
 jjs NR: k16 and l16, which is preferable?
 zhuge NR: but that was not the real one, minke. :)
 phd NR: is him the real da zu?
 kobayashi 9p: This match will continue till 11th of november
 zhuge NR: he must mean this series.
 jjs NR: is there any other alternatives around l3?
 phd NR: boy! i am going to sleep. i can't stay up 2 days.
 AlexG NR: neither k16 nor l16 but q14
 kobayashi 9p: That is, if it takes 7 games...
 LinLi 6d: w will play k3 or l3 next
 cty 1d: l4 maybe the choice for otake.
 AlexG NR: l3 is better than k3
 zhong NR: i am sleepy too.
 zhuge NR: i am fresh.
 zhuge NR: i just slept. :)
 AlexG NR: l4 looks fine too
 JW NR: should go to bed and come back later on.
 LinLi 6d: u can tell whether l3 is better or k3 is better
 jjs NR: i dont think b will go q14 if w o17.
 phd NR: have class tomorrow morning. when they adjourn tomorrow?
 zhuge NR: i like k3 better.
 zhuge NR: they will adjourn 7:40 from now.
 AlexG NR: k3 allows good extension for black
 jjs NR: l3 is from textbook, right?
 zhuge NR: sorry 7 hours 20 min.
 JW NR: they will adjourn at 10:00 in the morning.
 phd NR: so 10 am CST?

 sara 4k: thanks
 jjs NR: and there will problem to replay it if you mail the game to yourself, tons of comments
 JW NR: let's see it.
 kobayashi 9p: After w l3, b n3 is too small
 kobayashi 9p: Therefore B entered on f3
 Maaniker 9k: me to understand that
 zhuge NR: thanks.
 gandalf 1k: what w 13?
 zhong NR: is that all?
 Maaniker 9k: why not f16 now?
 jjs NR: what is your move, zhong?
 Xiong 10k: what's the idea of c14?
 Maaniker 9k: Does these big giuys ever loose on time
 zhong NR: f17 for w.
 tsand 2k: I don't like f16
 AlexG NR: white f16 would be clearly the wrong direction
 phd NR: let's have two 6d here play out the rest of the game see who wins
 kobayashi 9p: After B f3, if W pincers with h3 then B will play d4
 zhuge NR: good idea, phd.
 gandalf 1k: can u pll adjust ur raings, pls?
 jjs NR: why g17 is not good?
 kobayashi 9p: The continuation will make B strong and enable B n3 too
 gandalf 1k: it's nice to know the source of commentary a little better?.
 jjs NR: what is raings?
 willfor 8k: lear
 zhuge NR: that's from Guo Juan 5p.
 gandalf 1k: garbage : ratings/ranks/grades
 Maaniker 9k: what about c12?
 AlexG NR: c12 is too tight
 LinLi 6d: i am going to bed
 Maaniker 9k: I want to see some other game, please (some 6 dans) start play
 gandalf 1k: i'd still go for c10.
 zhong NR: i think if kobayashi played w, he would not go to f17 or f16, but for otake, he may just do that.
 kobayashi 9p: The kakari c14 is Kobayashi style again
 kobayashi 9p: It will make the game small-scale
 Maaniker 9k: C10 is meak
 sara 4k: Kobayashi likes territories?
 zhuge NR: yes, sara.
 tsand 2k: and to simplify
 AlexG NR: discretion is the better part of valor
 kobayashi 9p: An alternative for small-scale game is c10
 tornado 2d: perhaps it's the old question: what's the Chinese names of these tow, sorry for repeating the wquestion
 sara 4k: and Otake likes potential?
 gandalf 1k: maaniker: it's solid, not  meek
 barry 4d: otake is Daju yingxiong
 kobayashi 9p: B c14 is more aggresive than B c10
 zhong NR: otake likes good shape 1st.
 barry 4d: kobayashi is xiaolin guanyi
 sara 4k: i'd like to see a game kobayashi playing white and otake playing black
 hx 5d: right comment on Otake, zhong
 zhuge NR: that will be game 2, sara, but we dont' know if it will be live here.
 barry 4d: Otake's go is more beautiful but Kobayashi knows how to win.
 sara 4k: english name for otake's "space current"?
 jjs NR: so f16 is next move
 cty 1d: d11 could build up potentials.
 JW NR: otake=da zhu and kobayashi=xioa lin
 AlexG NR: Are they still thinking, or are we just waiting for a clump of moves?
 zhong NR: i think kobayashi likes fight a lot in recent games.
 barry 4d: watching professional go is like watching paint drying.
 AlexG NR: d11 doesn't seem to work well with the enclosure in the lower left
 jjs NR: kobayashi makes Su Shou a lot, but get good results.
 blowfish 5k: yes, buts is very >nice< paing :)

 LinLi 6d: that's thickness
 zhuge NR: c17 is expected, i would say.
 jonathan 8k: Go OTAKE!!! ;^)
 AlexG NR: c12 looks good. Don't want to let black extend along the left side
 fighter 3d: I prefer this joseki...
 Maaniker 9k: C10 is attack!
 kolian 4k: why then such a strange order?
 Maaniker 9k: When you can cut,CUT!!
 jonathan 8k: Takemiya doesn't care for white c17 much ...
 jjs NR: is c13 ok?

 Thor NR: sorry i mean w c15 , bd15?
 Maaniker 9k: B13
 phd NR: nie said kobayashi's style too greedy.
 tsand 2k: no
 jjs NR: b still can go c7 later
 dagge 1d: which nie?
 phd NR: nie 9p
 hx 5d: actually Nie himself, to :)
 sara 4k: anyone knows where the two players are?
 hx 5d: too
 zhuge NR: yes, agree with hx.
 barry 4d: You can hrdly call it too greedy. Just greedy enough I would say.
 gandalf 1k: sara, amsterdam
 sara 4k: both of them?
 ivan 2k: yes
 phd NR: nie is more flexiable.
 AlexG NR: I like Kobayishi's position
 tsand 2k: yes
 zhuge NR: yes they are facing to each other.
 sara 4k: i thought otake is in Louven
 phd NR: thisgame now is in kobyashi's style. 3 corners.
 sara 4k: belgium
 AlexG NR: where is the 3rd corner?
 sara 4k: right upper corner is not decided yet
 Maaniker 9k: But it WILL be.
 phd NR: he is going to tale upper corner most likely.
 AshaiRey 8k: Leuven, not Louven :-)
 AlexG NR: I forgot the joseki, what's the next move for black?
 zhuge NR: but b already has more stones there.
 tsand 2k: b14
 sara 4k: sorry  AshaiRey thanks
 lzy ???: d13 for b
 phd NR: b play D13, then W can't E13
 hx 5d: d13 only
 barry 4d: w's thickness in ul combines well with pressing moves at bottom.
 phd NR: L3 group too weak.
 barry 4d: I like w's position.
 jjs NR: b14 maybe better than d13
 kobayashi 9p: If you want to play W c12 the stone at f16 should be high (not f17)
 phd NR: w left empty even fater taking D13 stone
 gandalf 1k: d13 isn't any good as the ladder works for white
 asme 5d: c u guys. have fun here :-)
 jjs NR: if b goes d13, the left w may become stronger,?
 zhuge NR: i see.  so C12 was planned when w played F16.
 AlexG NR: b14 looks proper, but I'd hate to play there
 phd NR: left too big. b can live.
 jjs NR: but b should consider the liveness of d13 group at the same time, phd?
 phd NR: maybe play some test moves now before deciding
 kobayashi 9p: W c12 is important
 kobayashi 9p: If W c 17 instead, B c11 and the left edge is only interesting for B
 phd NR: d13 is sacrified.
 kobayashi 9p: No continuation for w on the left edge
 AlexG NR: pretty fat sacrifice
 khuang 7d: before f16, otake took long time to think about how to deal with yin zhen at the bottom. i think
 kobayashi 9p: Another reason for f16 (instead of f17):
 tsand 2k: yin zhen?
 phd NR: no, b can play M4 kind of move, plus he can invade left.
 kolian 4k: what yin zhen is?
 gandalf 1k: what's yin zhen???
 kobayashi 9p: The follow up move at W d18
 hx 5d: ladder
 zhuge NR: yin zhen = set up ladder.
 sara 4k: guys please  i want read the standard comments!
 gandalf 1k: thanx
 zhuge NR: don't worry sara, we have translators here. :)
 gandalf 1k: sara: fat chance
 sara 4k: my screen just keep rolling  and i could hardly read anything!
 jloup 8k: sara is right. please speak only if you have something to say. thanks.
 JW NR: you might want to log on france too.
 zhuge NR: could b play C13 next; i might.
 jjs NR: no, zhuge
 zhuge NR: why not good?
 m0184 6d: why black stop play, d 13 seems obvious
 tsand 2k: c13 is bad, no?
 barry 4d: c13 just helps w becomre strng
 zhuge NR: i see.  thanks.
 hx 5d: do u guys know who is Guo Juan?
 Maaniker 9k: B13
 jjs NR: who is she?
 tsand 2k: b-13-c13. not good

 kobayashi 9p: A possible fight may start after B m4

 m0184 6d: m4 is better, i think
 AlexG NR: after m4 m3, the latter still works

 LinLi 6d: if b n4, w will answer l5
 Maaniker 9k: D11, and w will be scared STIFF!!!
 phd NR: i like b's position.

 m0184 6d: it is not only ladder also the thickness
 AlexG NR: n4 l5 m2 looks bad for white

 barry 4d: b will play at top next.
 phd NR: c7
 jjs NR: top?
 tornado 2d: yi  zheng
 LinLi 6d: c7 is suicidal
 barry 4d: w left terrritory is open at edge. leave it for later.
 Maaniker 9k: as E14 would have neeb
 jjs NR: if b goes to top, w may attack f3 group
 jjs NR: and make a bigger moyo
 Maaniker 9k: why not R11?
 m0184 6d: this move will take a long time
 barry 4d: I would worry about such a moyo but Kobayashi seems not to.
 AlexG NR: how about j5 to break the latter, and then attack
 lzy ???: this move will take some time
 m0184 6d: now the game reached a critical stage
 Maaniker 9k: If you wish to attack the left, first attack the right!!! 8-)

 LinLi 6d: why stop here?

 AlexG NR: q2 looks interesting
 lzy ???: takamiya may not play at l2
 jjs NR: who is takamiya?
 lzy ???: w more confortble now.
 zhuge NR: takemiya = wu gong.
 barry 4d: takemiya is Wugong
 Maaniker 9k: A very orinetal dish
 zhuge NR: takemiya masaki. :)
 AlexG NR: l2 was important because it had to do with strength of groups
 hx 5d: different styles. b l2 exchange with w o6, i think w better, IMHO
 jjs NR: w got o6, good
 andrewr 9k: Agreed (even humbler)
 lzy ???: o8 possible next b move.
 barry 4d: KObayashi would reason that he got the substance.
 tornado 2d: w is more interesting,  wm2 will lose the aji
 jjs NR: i guess o6 is too much
 jjs NR: sorry, o8
 AlexG NR: I don't think white is too happy about having to play o6
 LinLi 6d: o8 is very risky
 barry 4d: m6 is an excellent follow up for w
 zhuge NR: i didn't imagine o8.
 jjs NR: what about n7?
 tornado 2d: that's right m6 is so good for w but b would be reluctant to play in the m areaa
 sara 4k: will b play q7?
 AlexG NR: n7 pushes white in the wrong direction
 LinLi 6d: next move seems very difficult
 Maaniker 9k: Q7 won't kill w
 lzy ???: if b play here , could be o8. if not o8, b may play someewhere else
 AlexG NR: q8 looks kobayashi style
 sara 4k: get territory while attacking...  not necessarily kill
 cty 1d: so many minds' q8 looks good.
 jjs NR: maybe b will go to left side
 jomar 5k: q8 looks quit good
 lzy ???: b will not go to the left. left is not important now.
 barry 4d: b could play l6 aiming at o5
 jjs NR: agree with barry
 tornado 2d: this is professional go,  every move leaves two alternatives for the player himself
 kobayashi 9p: According to Guo Juan l6 is too solid for B
 lzy ???: aroud o17 very big now.
 kobayashi 9p: Guo Juan proposes B q8
 zhuge NR: that agrees with a few IGSer here.
 zhuge NR: now we have only 65 people watching this game. :)
 gc 29k: she is a IGSer
 khuang 7d: how about r7?
 blowfish 5k: bq8, wm6?
 os 3k: Why ist the left not important (area around F6 looks important to me)?
 barry 4d: presumably kobayashi can't read our comments.
 jjs NR: so, it seems that d13 was not a good move for b
 m0184 6d: why w doesn't play Q 2 fisrt?
 LinLi 6d: r7 is Kitani's style
 andrewr 9k: I doubt that K would be interested :-)
 AlexG NR: I think black's doing fine
 lzy ???: because invation in to the left does not threaten the white.
 LinLi 6d: Kitani is both players teacher
 tornado 2d: otake's own principle: he'd rather lose beautifully ranther win ugly.   Lokking at his games, his stone shapes are admirable
 jjs NR: b q8, w o8, b where?
 zhuge NR: really?  also otake's?
 barry 4d: white won't answer q8 at o8
 LinLi 6d: Kitani= mu4 gu3
 tornado 2d: only otake i think 'da zhu'
 jjs NR: w may consider somewhere around e6?
 andrewr 9k: Is c7 big?
 barry 4d: forget about the left side for now.
 m0184 6d: move will be at the right side
 kompella 7k: Is K/L 9/10 big for both?
 jjs NR: ask lzy about k10
 AlexG NR: no
 zhuge NR: already too late, lzy would say :)
 cty 1d: B is deciding how to lead the game.
 kompella 7k: Well, lzy?
 AlexG NR: counting influence white is ahead by a couple points, but he
 tornado 2d: if b moves right, after w m6, w lose the attacking target.  Otake wrote a book with the similar pattern
 jjs NR: what about q6?
 AlexG NR: has a weak group
 AlexG NR: q6 too modest
 m0184 6d: i think maybe P 16
 m0184 6d: the white group already too rich in eye shape
 AlexG NR: p16??
 nic 14k: u mean o16?
 cty 1d: p16?
 m0184 6d: i think p 16, since the lower side white is too rich in eye shape
 AlexG NR: p16, really?
 jjs NR: how about k16?
 jjs NR: is Guo Juan watching our kibitzing?
 kobayashi 9p: According to Guo Juan: B q8 is direction of play
 JW NR: don't think so.
 andrewr 9k: would o2 threaten eye shape?
 kobayashi 9p: Black should avoid being forced in a low position on the right edge
 lzy ???: l2 coost black so much time!
 cty 1d: so l2 is a slow move.
 AlexG NR: it didn't cost anything, white responded.
 AlexG NR: l2 was a vital point
 jjs NR: so b o6 instead of l2 would be better?
 andrewr 9k: W response created problems, though, didn't it?
 kobayashi 9p: Kobayashi is studying the game record
 kobayashi 9p: Also "Kobayashi style"
 andrewr 9k: Wants to take a move back :-)
 barry 4d: if b had played o6 it would be a totally different game. but not necessarily better.
 jjs NR: is Kobayashi playing or studying?
 kompella 7k: Wants to know whose move it is :-)
 kobayashi 9p: They show pictures of Amsterdam!
 sara 4k: yours! :-)
 barry 4d: he likes to look at the game upside down.
 andrewr 9k: yoga. :-)
 cty 1d: zen.
 kobayashi 9p: You're right barry
 cty 1d: kobayashi likes zen.
 kompella 7k: Where would W answer Q8?
 barry 4d: w will answer q8 at m6
 jjs NR: b will answer m6 at l6?
 AlexG NR: yes
 tsand 2k: how long has B thought now?
 jjs NR: and then m7, l7, m8?
 andrewr 9k: half an hour
 cty 1d: if w m6, then b doesn't need to respond.

 deadly NR: what's Meijin in Chinese, I am novice to these jargons.

 barry 4d: Meijin = mingren
 zhuge NR: Meijin = ming2 ren2.

 kobayashi 9p: The Japanese television station NHK does several live transmissions from Amsterdam
 blowfish 5k: btw- if y'all over there get the chance, profusely thank the sponsers for us for allowing this to be broadcast over IGS.

 zhuge NR: there are 4 more major titles: Judan, Tengen, Oza, and Gosei.
 zhuge NR: teh 3 super-majors are best of 7, teh other 4 are best of 5.
 barry 4d: Kobayashi holds Kisei and Chasllenged for Honinbo.  he also
 jjs NR: the newspapaer must say some words of zhuge, he is great kibitzer and interprator here
 barry 4d: holds gosei
 zhuge NR: thanks jjs; they shouldn't miss you either if so. :)
 cty 1d: so quiet. tired?
 deadly NR: what's the Chinese name for Sakata
 jjs NR: its w's turn for long thinking?
 AlexG NR: no ideas on r10?
 barry 4d: Sakata=bantian
 deadly NR: i thought so, i saw a lot of scary 'Zhi Gu' in his games
 sara 4k: half day?
 barry 4d: no sloping field
 jjs NR: what is Zhi Gu?
 zhuge NR: BTW, zhi gu = rescure lone stones.
 cty 1d: b gains about 15 points by attacking.
 zhuge NR: where?
 cty 1d: right.
 jjs NR: wrong
 sara 4k: he meant right side?
 zhuge NR: that much?  how much were belong to him originally?
 jjs NR: ' 19 pts were belonging to him
 cty 1d: ca 12 ponts?
 lzy ???: I understand q6 is an excelent move now.
 fang 1d: what about r11 for white?
 jjs NR: and 21pts are belonging to him
 cty 1d: depending on how w deals with r14.
 rr 1k: can u explain it more detail, lzy(rr)
 AlexG NR: point counting is difficult, it all depends on how Otake gets out of this situation
 barry 4d: the right side is not territopry yet.  There is baslots of potential
 lzy ???: (q6+q8-p70 better than (q8)
 cty 1d: seems b is easier to move than w.
 barry 4d: p7 -q6 exchange looks even
 sara 4k: if b simply q8  what would w go?
 zhuge NR: q6?
 AlexG NR: white could force p7 q6 exchange after q8
 AlexG NR: so this couldn't be bad for black.
 jjs NR: but the force of p7 to q6 is not so good to w?
 khuang 7d: o16? or q12?
 lzy ???: o16
 AlexG NR: black didn't give him the choice ... it's always good to limit
 AlexG NR: the opponents choices
 deadly NR: there are two choices as khuang just said.  Both appeared in pro games before
 jjs NR: q12
 magnus 2k: IMVVHO q12 might destroy the aji round q8
 sara 4k: aji?
 barry 4d: aji = duwei or potential
 lzy ???: q12 seems greedy  for b.
 jjs NR: central potentail is much more impotant
 kobayashi 9p: Guo slightly favors o16
 zhuge NR: or one surface, aji = remaining taste.
 kobayashi 9p: The other move she considered is q12
 lzy ???: q 12 wants both sides.
 kobayashi 9p: It's difficult to reach a conclusion which is best
 magnus 2k: the potential of invading at r10 or cutting with wq5 bR7 wR8
 deadly NR: Rin (Lin Hai Feng) played q12 against the holder of Kisei (Teng Zhe) the moves were: b w q12 b q11 w q13 b r10 and then w o16
 AlexG NR: the upper side seems most impotant right now
 lzy ???: the upper side is bigger.
 lzy ???: because  it is the emptiest place.
 kobayashi 9p: Guo seems to agree with you lzy
 magnus 2k: is the whole board the same in the Rin-game?
 AlexG NR: Nobody likes r10?
 zhuge NR: lzy better shake hands with Guo if you can. :)
 magnus 2k: I do but it is too early, (I think)
 deadly NR: how can a whole board be the same in any two games, magnus?
 kobayashi 9p: White takes his time, position is difficult...
 sara 4k: there are two other games now :)
 jjs NR: if w o16, it will following order: o15,,n15, p15,, m16, ...?
 magnus 2k: A sequence in one game will not work in another if the POSITION is different.
 zhuge NR: well, it might work or it might not.
 jjs NR: then b o17?
 magnus 2k: agree
 deadly NR: i can accept this question,  the answer is i think so, if you want the question q12, go read the game record.
 zhuge NR: think about joseki
 khuang 7d: w o16, b q14, w r17, b r15, w q17; then b m17?
 lzy ???: if white o16, b likely q14.
 deadly NR: that's right, think about joseki,
 jjs NR: b maybe still want to attack o6 group, and
 cty 1d: isn't m17 too risky or deep?
 khuang 7d: i did not like w r14. now, it's hard for w to play.
 sara 4k: where did you like then?
 lzy ???: me too .
 lzy ???: I did not like it at the begining.
 jjs NR: he liked n16
 zhuge NR: they liked n16/o17
 lzy ???: r14 seems ' hate territory'.
 khuang 7d: w 09, b q10; then w 016. before w r14
 deadly NR: won't be difficult for Cho though
 AlexG NR: if you play o16 now the exchange r14 r12 isn't bad for white
 jjs NR: can b ignore if w played o9?
 barry 4d: .36 minutes so far on this move
 lzy ???: ' exchange is not good for white.
 zhuge NR: longest move so far?
 jjs NR: i will go home after next move
 sara 4k: me too
 barry 4d: me too
 zhuge NR: BTW, they will have a lunch break.
 gandalf 1k: how far do the server ti (thinking time) refelct reality?
 sara 4k: now i think pro games are not fun at all :_)
 gandalf 1k: when is the lunch break scheduled?
 barry 4d: just think if you were in the room with them and had to be quiet
 zhuge NR: we have 4 hours 45 min left today.
 kobayashi 9p: We are not sure, but they might be gone for the lunch break at this moment
 RubberDoll NR: On TV they say Otake has fallen asleep.
 kobayashi 9p: I will phone the hotel to ask
 kobayashi 9p: From the screen (board) it's not clear to us
 kolian 4k: he meditates:)
 RubberDoll NR: Now a functinear is shaking his shoulder..
 kobayashi 9p: It's 12.15 here
 RubberDoll NR: What a confused look
 jjs NR: its 5:16am here
 zhuge NR: it's 3:17 am here. :)

 jjs NR: astronomer
 jjs NR: oh, icant, i got to get up at 11:am
 gandalf 1k: EGCC European Go and Cultural Centre
 kobayashi 9p: about forty peolple i count in this room, there may be more playing somewhere else in the building
 zhuge NR: okay, see you tomorrow then.
 kobayashi 9p: Hi, some updates:
 gandalf 1k: the place where the transmission comes from
 barry 4d: time for me to go too bye.
 kobayashi 9p: The players played last move at 11:40 (i.e. 40 minutes ago)
 sara 4k: thanks guys
 jjs NR: c u guys, bye
 kobayashi 9p: At that moment it was clear that the next move would take some time
 kobayashi 9p: That's why lunch break started half an hour ago
 gandalf 1k: r they having the break then?
 kobayashi 9p: They will continue in half an hour (about)
 gandalf 1k: ok, answered
 lzy ???: when will they be back to the game?
 sara 4k: when will the game resume then?
 kobayashi 9p: Some comments from the pro-analyse room:
 kobayashi 9p: According to the pro's white is better, reasons:
 kobayashi 9p: w group below can live easily starting with q2
 kobayashi 9p: white could make a ponnuki with d12
 kobayashi 9p: white could invade the last big area on the right with r14
 zhuge NR: d12?
 kobayashi 9p: These three reasons mean: w is better
 sara 4k: ponnuki?
 kobayashi 9p: That's it for now...
 tsand 2k: d13=ponnuki
 gandalf 1k: ponnuki shape after capturing 1 stone
 christie 2d: Have they gone to lunch ?
 kobayashi 9p: Play will be resumed in 35 minutes from now
 gandalf 1k: guo, keep up the good work
 zhuge NR: yes adn they'll be back in about half an hour.
 zhuge NR: thanks jansteen.
 cty 1d: one game length for IGSers.
 sara 4k: thanks guys
 sara 4k: you guys have been a lot of fun
 gandalf 1k: u r worth u weight (which isn't much anyway) in shell stones, guo!!! :-)
 sara 4k: i will go back home to get some sleep
 sara 4k: see you guys
 sara 4k: hope i can catch the end :)
 nic 14k: me too... g'night everybody
 zhuge NR: later, sara.
 cty 1d: anyone start a fast game for us to watch?
 blowfish 5k: cool, then I gota a chance to finich my work :)
 kobayashi 9p: good idea cty, here players are playing ligthning tournament
 cty 1d: what's lighting?
 zhuge NR: too bad i am using a slow modem... otherwise i'd like a game with cty -- long time no play. :)
 kobayashi 9p: a quick game (10min or so)
 kobayashi 9p: we will leave the terminal for 20 min., se u later!
 cty 1d: i see. my modem is slow too. takes 15 sec to type in a move.
 cty 1d: or anyone can mimic the game to the end fast.
 cty 1d: zhuge, can you give us a beep when game is resumed?
 zhuge NR: sure.  i will shout loud. :)
 cty 1d: thanks.
 AlexG NR: any word on what's up?
 zhuge NR: lunch break now.  back in 15 min.
 ruebezahl ???: is r12 really the last move ?
 weiz 6k: hi, could anyone translate the title: Meijin, Kisei and Gosei in chinese to me?
 jive 4k: come on, dans, we know you can say something
 bn 2k: the dans are using another channel to talk. :-)
 kobayashi 9p: still lunchbreak
 magnus 2k: for how long?
 ruebezahl ???: kobayashi = guo juan ?
 weiz 6k: sorry, i lost my connection just after i typed my question. so i didn't get the answer.
 zhuge NR: what was your question?
 weiz 6k: could anyone answer me again? what are the titles: Meijin, Kisei, and Gosei in chinese?
 ruebezahl ???: my 1kyu impression is, that kobayashi is doing well here
 bn 2k: Meijin=Ming Ren, Kisei=Qi Sheng
 ruebezahl ???: has there been any professional comment yet ?
 bn 2k: but Gosei is actually QiSheng too.
 weiz 6k: thanks
 zhuge NR: Kisei is the 'big' QiSheng, Gosei the 'small' one.  two different Chinese character.
 bn 2k: Or Gosei is (wei)qi sheng. :-)
 zhuge NR: yes.  good translation.
 weiz 6k: i see, thanks bn and zhuge
 kobayashi 9p: there has not been a live prof comment yet. The profs in the analysis room had the impression white is ahead. Reasons: the w group on the lower side can make n easy live with q2.
 kobayashi 9p: Furthermore the w ponnuki on the left is very strong and w has played first on the right side.
 kobayashi 9p: Lunch is over; the players sit down again.
 lzy ???: is the game resumed?
 cty 1d: zhuge. will this game be finished today?
 zhuge NR: it should.
 fang 1d: i think it's a 2 days game.
 kolian 4k: No! It will be next session tomorrow
 kobayashi 9p: As far as we have seen on tv, someone has taken a place at the board. We presume it's Otake
 kobayashi 9p: The real operators at this place know how to addtime, but we're not sure yet.
 zhuge NR: eight hours today, eight more plus byo-yomi tomorrow.
 fighter 3d: otake's thinking begin.... next move will takes time
 tsand 2k: addtime x
 jive 4k: did they eat on otake's time?
 kobayashi 9p: Time will be added as soon as the real operators are back.
 fighter 3d: otake saw R12 after resume the game.
 zhuge NR: i see -- R12 was the 'sealed move'?
 fighter 3d: yes, in my guess
 zhuge NR: what if otake logged on IGS during lunch break? :)
 lzy ???: I bet not.
 fang 1d: break is a break. time all 0
 zhuge NR: i guess the next move by otake is the sealed move.
 lzy ???: agree.
 zhuge NR: so no sealed move for the break or what?
 bn 2k: what is the move that takes the longe' what is the move that takes the longest time? how long?
 bn 2k: so far, i meant.
 kobayashi 9p: fot lunch no move has been sealed
 zhuge NR: according to IGS, this coming W move has taken the longest time...but it was a move before lunch break.
 zhuge NR: before that, B P4 took awful long time.
 AlexG NR: what's the consensus? o16? q12?
 fang 1d: C'mon...
 zhuge NR: hurry up!  pro's are sloooowww. :)
 cty 1d: that's pro's pro. pro one thing all day.
 fang 1d: Otake may need a dice for help?
 zhuge NR: a dice?
 AlexG NR: probably no more than a coin
 gandalf 1k: why not guessing even or odd?
 blowfish 5k: Ahh, the pros. Gotta love 'em :)
 zhuge NR: what are they doing?  brushing teeth?
 AlexG NR: just be glad Fisher doesn't play go
 kobayashi 9p: They're thinking zhuge!
 kolian 4k: AlexG is right:)
 zhuge NR: they are?
 blowfish 5k: but the possibilities would be highly amusing, to be sure :)
 kobayashi 9p: I hope so zhuge
 blowfish 5k: No! Its all Fixed! Kobayashi is a lowly dog! >I'm< the Meijin Champion!!! :)
 zhuge NR: you know, jansteen, the real zhuge did stand for wisdom.  so it would be good if they are thinking zhuge. :)
 AlexG NR: SO when do we see, GO the musical?
 kolian 4k: zhuge: tell who was zhuge?
 kobayashi 9p: phufff, he, he...
 zhuge NR: Zhuge Liang, born 181 AD ('died' 234 AD) was a great strategist during a period called Three Kingdomes.

 camillo 1k: Do you think kobayashi is the best player in Japan?
 godok 1k: any comment about r15?
 AlexG NR: it looks like otake found exactly what he needed
 zhuge NR: to say 'one of the best' is safe.
 andrewr 9k: "best" is very ill-defined  :-)
 kobayashi 9p: r15 is only move according to Guo
 deadly NR: best according the titles he holds

 cty 1d: khuang guessed m17!

 deadly NR: or 4-5p
 deadly NR: o18?
 AlexG NR: if it weren't for m17, black would be very unhappy
 AlexG NR: Ilike o18
 fang 1d: o18 is too slow
 kobayashi 9p: we prefer n17
 deadly NR: Rin's classical book 'Shape and Tesuki' has the exact display and the right answer was o18
 ruebezahl ???: k17 ?
 kolian 4k: after m17 is w upper right corner in danger?
 deadly NR: because o18 is too good for b
 kolian 4k: I'd prefer k16
 ruebezahl ???: locally, i'd play o18, but the upper side seems important
 kobayashi 9p: k17 is answered by p17
 AlexG NR: I'm persuaded that n17 is good.

;B[ld]C[
 kobayashi 9p: one-zero for Amsterdam (!)
 deadly NR: so it is

;W[fo]C[
 kobayashi 9p: How about next move boys?
 AlexG NR: k16?
 fang 1d: is p14 the right time?
 kobayashi 9p: we propose p14
 blowfish 5k: k17
 cty 1d: p14
 AlexG NR: after p14 black lives easily
 gandalf 1k: and after p14? b s14 and then what?
 fang 1d: then k16
 weiz 6k: k17
 gandalf 1k: would j/k 17/16 be wrong direction)?
 ruebezahl ???: j17
 AlexG NR: it's not clearly the wrong direction
 kobayashi 9p: When playing around k16, then k16 is better than k17
 deadly NR: emotionally, i'd play k16,  only speaking for myself though
 cty 1d: if only w can catch m17 group.
 kobayashi 9p: It can get complicated after:
 AlexG 5d: no chance
 kobayashi 9p: W p14 , B s14 , W k16 ...
 kobayashi 9p: For example: B n16 , W o17 , B o15 , W n15 ...
 AlexG 5d: I didn't realize p14 forces s14
 gandalf 1k: oi oi oi
 AlexG 5d: sorry, my coordinate were off by one ..
 kobayashi 9p: So maybe: W p14 , B s14 , W k16 , B m14
 kobayashi 9p: Therefore the kikashi at p14 bight (might) be bad
 lzy ???: neither of the two players is moyo oriented.
 kobayashi 9p: The p14 move costs a lot of (endgame) points
 AlexG 5d: what about k17 after k16?
 andrewr 9k: might b answer p14 at p15?
 lzy ???: they seems not like moyo.
 gandalf 1k: a ko fihght is the lawst b wishes for, andrewr
 cty 1d: what's the mening of moyo?
 AlexG 5d: I agree about the KO fight
 lzy ???: I do not like w q17
 deadly NR: kibitz moyo='Da Du Pi'
 cty 1d: i see. thks.
 zhuge NR: moyo = mo2 yang2 (even same characters in Chinese and Japanese)
 zhuge NR: sorry, mo2 yang4.
 lzy ???: why white not q15 after b r13?
 cty 1d: like dialect.
 lzy ???: kobayashi style is realy solid.
 AlexG 5d: I was thinking about that, apparently otake thought this was a better
 AlexG 5d: way to take the corner
 AlexG 5d: Oh no Otake's thinking again!
 zhuge NR: is that scary? :)
 kolian 4k: maybe they eat supper nw:)
 kolian 4k: nw=now
 fang 1d: long thinking made foul move.
 zhuge NR: not so fast.  they got to digest the food. :)
 cty 1d: food makes them sleepy.
 AlexG 5d: I see no way to attack really effectively
 lzy ???: I think M16 makes b very happy.
 AlexG 5d: you bet
 deadly NR: i agree with lzy, perhaps o18 was a 'tai ji'
 cty 1d: m14?

 kobayashi 9p: so it was a diappointment for b

 Gene 4d: i think the differecne between pro and us is that they can have 2 huor for considering one move'
 kobayashi 9p: Sorry, yes, two more hours to play before they adjourn
 kobayashi 9p: How about w d9 now?
 klooster 12k: any idea of the real time they used?
 magnus 2k: if d9 g6 f6 black maybe can sacrifice c7-d7 and attack white on right side???
 ruebezahl ???: tell Caddy hab schon gesehen, 1h idle time
 deadly NR: i advocate d9
 godok 1k: i would play there :-)
 zhuge NR: close to what is shown.
 kobayashi 9p: That's true zhuge
 lzy ???: if w d9, b can get out easily.
 kobayashi 9p: how lzy?
 ruebezahl ???: ho
 lzy ???: g7 may work for black.
 ruebezahl ???: sls
 ruebezahl ???: est
 ruebezahl ???: ho
 tsand 2k: ?
 ruebezahl ???: orry
 Gene 4d: if i were w i would play sonewhere else'
 ruebezahl ???: orry, i'm fighting with the client
 AlexG 5d: d9 looks necesary
 kobayashi 9p: after W d9 , B g7 white has the cut at e7 left, but maybe attacking with j6 first?
 Gene 4d: thanks, i like like to attack m17 something.
 zhuge NR: whose words kobayashi is showing?
 zhuge NR: jansteens?
 kobayashi 9p: mars's words :)
 zhuge NR: really?
 nates 14k: i think so, both players are typed by jansteen?
 kobayashi 9p: really!
 AshaiRey 8k: kobayashi is typed by jansteen, otake by me.
 kobayashi 9p: Otake is pondering deeply now
 AshaiRey 8k: Jan tells me the move that otake should do and I just enter it.
 kobayashi 9p: He is moving to and fro and playing with his fan all the time
 AshaiRey 8k: Easy job :-)
 nates 14k: and Guo is nearby to make comments?
 kobayashi 9p: Guo Juan gives public commentaries every now and then
 lzy ???: if w d9, black may makes some movess first before trying to get out.
 kobayashi 9p: She also answers questions, and plays teaching games
 AlexG 5d: like what?
 lzy ???: I do not know.
 magnus 2k: can anyone see a good move for black after d9 g6 f6 ?
 AlexG 5d: I don't either, c9 doesn't look too productive
 AlexG 5d: resign?
 godok 1k: w may not play d9
 zhuge NR: resign?  on Day 1?
 godok 1k: possible but not this game, IMHO
 ruebezahl ???: i wonder if otake has a splitting attack in mind
 AlexG 5d: He definitely does
 Gene 4d: i supposed'
 nates 14k: there is something about f5-h8 thats looks a little thin
 lzy ???: my feeling is that this group is safe and white maynot ploay at d9.
 godok 1k: otake is thinking of attack top and left b stones together, IMO
 Gene 4d: is that true, otake?'
 kobayashi 9p: already 21 minutes for this move...
 godok 1k: very important place....
 barber1k 1k: off
 godok 1k: need lots of thinking....
 zhuge NR: otake has used one hour more than kobayashi.
 otake 9p: I always consider all possibilities :-)
 zhuge NR: it's amazing both kobayashi and otake can see our kibitzes (i mean the two accounts)
 lzy ???: but there are too many possibilites , right?
 Gene 4d: that is the reason he took so much time.'
 kobayashi 9p: This seems a critical possition
 zhuge NR: right: there are nearly 300 empty points on the board. :)
 USA 1k: execuse me, who support this game?
 klooster 12k: zhuge: simple.. use 3 terminals
 zhuge NR: three?  that many?
 klooster 12k: don't know.. just guessing..
 otake 9p: Essentially right klooster. The problem is that not all three are at the same place.
 Gene 4d: may be w s14 b s15  wp14 then attack m17?'
 zhuge NR: who support this game?  i suppos
 zhuge NR: i guess everyone here is supporting the game (i.e. IGS is supporting the game.)
 AlexG 5d: possibly
 USA 1k: Mr. kobayashi said that As
 zhuge NR: but we cannot see it without jansteen and AshaiRey.
 zhuge NR: oops.  you mean the game played in teh hotel?
 AshaiRey 8k: Who has the goban on his back ? :-)
 kobayashi 9p: The game is sponsored by Asahi Shinbun, Japanese newspaper
 kobayashi 9p: Hi Xuegen Hurston!
 zhuge NR: gee kobayashi now knows pinyin! :)
 hurston 1d: kobayashi is jansteen
 zhuge NR: when did he learn Chinese Pinyin?
 jmb NR: who is otake
 zhuge NR: AshaiRey is typing moves played by otake.
 kobayashi 9p: Otake looks really busy finding the next move
 tsand 2k: busy?
 nates 14k: watching this game: 53, including of course AshaiRey
 ding 1k: are you guys going to watch for next 12 hours?
 USA 1k: doesn't m6 come today?
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, busy, moving, playing with his fan, drinking...
 ruebezahl ???: it will not last that long
 zhuge NR: next 12 hours?  not necessay.
 klooster 12k: game will be adjourned in 1 1/2 hours
 zhuge NR: it will adjourn in an hour and half.
 zhuge NR: drinking?  tea, water, or sake? :)
 ding 1k: so you will watch an unfinished game... :)
 kolian 4k: Holland beer:)
 zhuge NR: kobayashi's time advantage has increased to about 80 min.
 ruebezahl ???: thinking of holland...

 panx 10k: are they real?
 AlexG 5d: I don't think white lost sente

 m6 IGS92: w needs sente to do what?
 AlexG 5d: The strategy of the attack is clear, but I can't find the exact variation

;B[kb]C[
 AlexG 5d: white needs sente to continue the splitting attack
 m6 IGS92: r they at amsterdam?
 zhuge NR: yes.
 m6 IGS92: so ishida 9p is with them?
 kobayashi 9p: Ishida is referee, and in the hotel
 lzy ???: I think w wants territory now.
 zhuge NR: ishida 9p is the refereee today.
 m6 IGS92: thanks, kobayashi :-)
 m6 IGS92: so thats why ishida played here 2 days ago
 panx 10k: i wonder what's happening with the 3 b stones on the left
 kobayashi 9p: right
 magnus 2k: I dont understand the last move why anyone???
 tsand 2k: really?
 Gene 4d: who is ishida z 1/tiny?
 AlexG 5d: gain territory and remove eye-shape
 m6 IGS92: maybe after w j17, m18 will become gote
 kobayashi 9p: ishida = "stone field"
 zhuge NR: no, ishida is not ztiny.
 lzy ???: the last move looks realy like pro ones.
 Gene 4d: the man who smels good?'
 m6 IGS92: the america's name of city is really like those in japan

 Gene 4d: then b j17
 LinLi 6d: b has two weak groups
 AlexG 5d: the group on the upper side is not too weak?
 kobayashi 9p: He didn't smell bad Gene :)
 LinLi 6d: my feeling is otake will win this game
 m6 IGS92: the monitor of pro's match is really nice
 Gene 4d: thanks kolian
 LinLi 6d: kobayashi seldom won a game overseas, out of japan
 m6 IGS92: if we can see other matches in japan, that will be really excellent
 kolian 4k: You're welcome,Gene
 AlexG 5d: I think the game will depend on the resolution of the left side
 m6 IGS92: j17 is a hard move for a pro, i guess
 LinLi 6d: isn't j17 the only move
 panx 10k: gote
 lzy ???: I think j17 is the only move locolly.
 zhuge NR: how about j18?
 m6 IGS92: but hard
 AlexG 5d: maybe d9 now
 m6 IGS92: if j18, b j15 is almost sente
 lzy ???: j18 not as good as j17.
 zhuge NR: i see.
 ychen 6d: what? no comments! nobody dare to (?)
 lzy ???: j18 give b sente at j15.
 hurston 1d: so , White better play J15?
 zhuge NR: ychen can't hear us :)
 m6 IGS92: r3 is a potential move, both w and b remembers this, imo
 AlexG 5d: I thought r3 didn't work
 m6 IGS92: r3 wont work now, i mean the corner is not completed
 klooster 12k: CU all later.. have fun, and go for the 2 MegaBytes :-)
 lzy ???: white really like slow moves.
 ychen 6d: thanks all. someone turns my kibitzs off. :)
 LinLi 6d: usually, otake plays very fast
 Gene 4d: p16 for b get connection'
 panx 10k: how about attacking left b stones first
 Gene 4d: sorry mis reading'
 AlexG 5d: my estimate white 23+komi black 28
 m6 IGS92: i think its little bit hard for w now
 Gene 4d: p16 is ok for b'
 m6 IGS92: if w cant attack b successfully, w will lost
 AlexG 5d: i agree
 zhuge NR: so W is thinking hard.
 LinLi 6d: w is not bad, IMHO
 AlexG 5d: my count was based on white's destroying the right side while attacking
 m6 IGS92: especially, f5 and h8 is not very thick
 AlexG 5d: escape through g7 is not easy
 m6 IGS92: but i guess w wont let this move to be the last move today
 LinLi 6d: i really want to know what they are thinking now, i mean the content of their thinking
 m6 IGS92: h8 is not thick, doesnot means b has to escape from g7
 lzy ???: b d7 c7 two stones maybe abandonable if black get something outside.
 zhuge NR: IGS should set up a monitor to show their brain waves. :)
 LinLi 6d: good idea, zhuge!
 m6 IGS92: because b has b14, i think all c7d7f8 r abandonable
 lzy ???: why pros is never tired?
 LinLi 6d: because they can get big money in such a match
 zhuge NR: they love the game.

;B[me]C[
 kolian 4k: because they get used
 m6 IGS92: but pro lose their bodyweight very significantly
 lzy ???: j17 is the abviously only move!!!
 zhuge NR: so?
 nates 14k: but it was hard to swallow....
 m6 IGS92: although chaochigun said he didnt lose body weight during kisei hon in bo match
 lzy ???: but still took so much time.
 zhuge NR: wow already 74 moves... :)
 LinLi 6d: it's much shorter than in the old days
 zhuge NR: pro's way to show off (spending long time on obvious moves)
 m6 IGS92: if w do j17 first, m18 wont be sente
 deadly NR: one has to admire/hate pros 'Chang Kao Gong'
 LinLi 6d: in the old days, such a game would last at least one month
 m6 IGS92: i guess this mv was hard for ootake
 m6 IGS92: cu guys
 zhuge NR: what's kobayashi's impulse now, i wonder.
 LinLi 6d: i think 99/min
 zhuge NR: i guess 360/min.
 AlexG 5d: black might be able to play c10 now
 deadly NR: kobayashi is probably thinking how to make h8 a bad move
 ruebezahl 25k: is it possible to play at f9 now ?

;W[lq]C[
 panx 10k: good move
 kolian 4k: fooled you, huh?
 Gene 4d: o9 may become very big.
 zhuge NR: is d9 really a bad move?  w seems not interested.

;B[er]C[
 panx 10k: if b becomes strong in the center, left group will survive
 zhuge NR: surprised me.
 deadly NR: what a pachtient move
 LinLi 6d: w wants to make another b group weak
 deadly NR: i mean patient
 kolian 4k: bye all
 Gene 4d: this move is improtant'
 zhuge NR: but never thought he'd make it now.
 LinLi 6d: w is accumulating strength
 nates 14k: n15 sort of prompted it....
 deadly NR: pro often say that this is one of difference between amt and pro players, they know wait and see
 LinLi 6d: then w wants to give out a fatal blow
 hurston 1d: W wants to get thicker by attack this group in order to catch the left 3 B stones
 lzy ???: b c9 or c10.
 hurston 1d: then W E2 sth
 magnus 2k: I think that if white get the left side black can play m3 because of N15
 lzy ???: or b d2 first
 ychen 6d: m3 doesn't appear to be aggressive enough (to me :) ),  yes, i may like to c9
 hurston 1d: no, the upper black gruop is un-attackable now
 lzy ???: before defennding the left groud.
 gandalf 1k: are the 'times' given on the server about accurate?
 zhuge NR: yes.
 godok 1k: where is b's weakness?
 zhuge NR: but you have to type 'time 0' to see more accurate clock.
 kobayashi 9p: I think this is a nicetell hurs
 kobayashi 9p: sorry...

 kobayashi 9p: Kyonari is the NHK TV commentator for the match
 kobayashi 9p: He has a weekly program on Japanese TV (sundays)
 lounela 3d: How much is black's lead? I get a bit less than 10 points.

 barry 4d: w probably has to play at n11 aiming to cut a t top.
 kobayashi 9p: K(yonari) said that maybe b-d13 would have been better just connect at b14
 weipingsan NR: n10 is questionable. if b counterattack, w can do something (not sure what).

 zhong NR: i don't understand kyonari comments. isn't d13 joseki?
 kobayashi 9p: d13 is joseki, but b14 too :)
 tof NR: b14 is also a joseki
 kobayashi 9p: B couldn't utilise the ladder aji
 barry 4d: d13 is joseki. but so is b14.  White doesn't become so thick if b14
 jjs NR: i would prefer b14 too at yesterday's case
 ajiko NR: black groups are weak. White certainly will get some points in the middle
 zhong NR: could not? i think b had utilized it already
 mk 3d: he may have said that b's utilization is not better than w's thickness
 zhong NR: then that makes more sense.
 jjs NR: b is better now, if b was at b14, he is even better?
 barry 4d: If black gets to hane at N11 he can't possibly lose.
 kobayashi 9p: After W r14 the opinion of the pro's in Amsterdam was:
 kobayashi 9p: White is better because (3 reasons)
 ajiko NR: I though so
 kobayashi 9p: White has a ponnuki
 kobayashi 9p: White's group O3 is alive
 jjs NR: how b got a chance to go c7?
 kobayashi 9p: White could enter the right side first (with W r14)
 tof NR: what's ponnuki?
 kobayashi 9p: ponnuki = shape after one stone capture
 zhong NR: w is at r14
 ruebezahl 25k: the proverb says, the ponnuki is worth 30 points
 tof NR: thanks, kobayashi and gandalg
 magnus 2k: look at d13 tof!
 ruebezahl 25k: so otake has a lead in territory
 jjs NR: ponnuki is KaiHua
 watanabe 4d: the dan players here probably didn't count that 30 points
 tof NR: sorry gandalf
 zhuge NR: my goodness!  finally got it.
 zhuge NR: i meant finally got in here.
 cty 1d: hard to login?
 jjs NR: zhuge, u r late for one hour today
 zhuge NR: which was the sealed move yesterday?
 tweet NR: you took 1.5 hours to get here.
 AlexG 5d: the indication of wqhiyte's usccess is his ability to play s16
 zhuge NR: it was more like 1.5 days to me. :)
 kobayashi 9p: the sealed move was: B d3
 jjs NR: zhuge is in San F?
 tweet NR: you have to take me to lunch now.
 zhong NR: one and half month
 tof NR: confused, AlexG
 zhuge NR: again, anyone knows which was the sealed move?
 tsand 2k: d3
 zhuge NR: i see.  thanks
 zhuge NR: i am in berkeley but using an account in S.F.
 gandalf 1k: guo yuan. can u give an estimate of the size of the propestive territories?
 AlexG 5d: s16 was the first mutually large pure endgame move
 gandalf 1k: ... prospective ...
 zhuge NR: who's better now?
 kobayashi 9p: Guo is not here today (she has a course)
 zhong NR: guys, enough is enough :-). bye.
 tof NR: when did u move to berkeley, zhuge? i thought u are a wildcat in Chicago :)
 jjs NR: perspactive?
 zhuge NR: a course?

;B[lm]C[
 gandalf 1k: who is commenting then?
 tweet NR: school
 kobayashi 9p: a computer course
 zhuge NR: oh yeah, home in berkeley, school in chicago.
 tof NR: a course means a dish sometimes
 ajiko NR: Nice and simple
 kobayashi 9p: At this moment no comments yet in the centre
 lounela 3d: Oh, wonder.
 tof NR: dish is an attemping word to me right now...
 gandalf 1k: pity
 kobayashi 9p: Later, Frank Janssen, 6d, will give analysis here
 barry 4d: N11 threatens (future) cut at O15
 AlexG 5d: is o15 that` dangerous?
 mk 3d: b o12 can prevent the cut
 gandalf 1k: when will frank janssen be there?
 magnus 2k: does the cut o15 make a move like j14 or something sente?
 barry 4d: O15 not dangerous unless combined with attack on left.
 barry 4d: How dangerous is a move like Q11?
 kobayashi 9p: maybe in one hour
 ajiko NR: b needs to defend the left soon, huh?
 zhuge NR: i wouldn't say it's safe.
 gandalf 1k: let's hope ...
 jjs NR: m8?
 AlexG 5d: q11 doesn't seem to work
 watanabe 4d: white may get some center territory
 barry 4d: I f white gets to play at G10 makes lots of territory while attacking.
 lounela 3d: Is there a possibility of double attack?
 jjs NR: b at h9?
 ajiko NR: I think white will just make territory in the middle.
 watanabe 4d: I agree
 watanabe 4d: I wonder what is REALLY going on
 Cheng 6d: o12?
 zhuge NR: what do you mean, watanabe?
 ajiko NR: H9 = overplay (i think)
 gandalf 1k: everybody is taken for granted that black leads, if at all, only by a little
 AlexG 5d: I like o12
 barry 4d: b will play at h9?
 gandalf 1k: but where's white's territory?
 zhuge NR: what do you REALLY mean? :)
 watanabe 4d: maybe we have completely wrong ideas
 watanabe 4d: find out that person we thought was leading,
 watanabe 4d: was actually far behind and game was hopeless
 blowfish 5k: Amsterdamn pros think White is ahead, we Kibitzers call it Black ahead...
 kobayashi 9p: Ishida Yoshio explains that when W gets thicker in the center...
 lounela 3d: Black has more territory, but w has lots of potential attacks.
 kobayashi 9p: W will attack the lower-edge with W g2
 ajiko NR: B H9 gets cut off and B cant manage both H9 and his group on left.
 m0184 6d: b next move, n 9  ?
 zhuge NR: ishida 9p is the referee right?  and he made comments too?
 jjs NR: so how about f10?
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, several people appear on TV
 tof NR: and i bet he would only let one of the players know, zhuge :)
 Cheng 6d: long thinking
 kobayashi 9p: Ishida, Takagi, Kyonari, ...
 watanabe 4d: next move is o11 or p12?
 tof NR: translate please, zhuge. maybe i know some of them, as in Chinese
 zhuge NR: ishida = shi2 tian2 fang fu
 kompella 7k: B seems way ahead time-wise ... are the times accurate?
 jjs NR: next move is n9 or
 tof NR: good. computer program. manyfaces
 zhuge NR: manyfaces?
 magnus 2k: I have a feeling that this is when Kobayashi will use all his extra time ...
 AlexG 5d: j14 is important so o12 is good  because it makes j14 no longer kikashi
 zhuge NR: i feel taht your feeling is right, magnus.
 otake 9p: We have not compensated for the time that berkely was down yesterday.
 kobayashi 9p: The time is just indication I'm afraid
 tof NR: Ishida was nicked as computer since he got No.1 calculation for the judgement of the situation
 kobayashi 9p: Sometimes it takes some time to be able to see the next move...
 tof NR: no matter how complex it may be
 zhuge NR: well we'll have another lunch break today right?
 tsand 2k: you can use addtime

;W[ni]C[
 jjs NR: no one guessed m7
 kobayashi 9p: The lunch break is 1:45 hours from now
 magnus 2k: surprised? I am
 tof NR: who r the other two, zhuge? please?
 blowfish 5k: why surprised? isn't it a chance to break into the white center while creating more eye potential?
 AlexG 5d: I am
 zhuge NR: i missed the name -- jan, who were the other two 9p's appeared on TV?
 watanabe 4d: I'm not so surprised - make group safe
 AlexG 5d: kikashi means a threat
 barry 4d: I am surprised but looking at it . ity looks good.
 kobayashi 9p: Kyonari, 9p and Takagi, 9p
 watanabe 4d: but black loses territory on right
 barry 4d: others were Kyonari and Takagi.

;B[pj]C[
 jjs NR: my feeling is that b should separate n12 stones

 zhuge NR: takagi = gao mu4 (high bridge :)
 tof NR: i like q10
 tof NR: Gao Mu Xiang Xiong?
 mk 3d: now w n11 group is thin
 tof NR: he is only demonstrating or narrating lately, i guess
 watanabe 4d: I think q10 is necessary
 zhuge NR: not sure: gao mu xiang yi?
 m0184 6d: black is only trying to safety play
 barry 4d: W n11 group is not thin.
 tof NR: maybe u r right, zhuge :)
 ajiko NR: B is taking care of weak groups. What kind of play is that ?!~-
 AlexG 5d: w. is caught up on points now
 barry 4d: w s14 may become sente later.

 tof NR: tell me the page no. and i will try it myself :)
 jjs NR: zhuge needs a dict.? just check the sky
 ajiko NR: Making points in the middle.
 watanabe 4d: white doing well
 zhuge NR: well, i guess kyonari is qu3 li4 qi3.
 barry 4d: l8 is a very thick moove typical of otake.
 zhuge NR: kyonari = qu3 (bent shape)
 barry 4d: I would find it a bit too slow.

 AlexG 5d: s14 could be nasty

 tof NR: thanks, zhuge
 zhuge NR: yes, k8 would be my move made in 2 seconds. :)
 zhuge NR: my pleasure.
 AlexG 5d: k8 is thick but it could be slow
 kobayashi 9p: (locally) how about W j9 instead of W k8
 lugq 2d: g10
 lugq 2d: g10
 tof NR: show more authority, kobayashikun :-)
 zhuge NR: he's not the real kobayashi, tof san. :)

 zhuge NR: ah.
 tof NR: u r telling the wrong guy, zhuge san :)

;W[jg]C[
 os 3k: I am surprised how black managed to put two groups in the face of the white thickness
 barry 4d: At least b rll was totally obvious.
 kobayashi 9p: I guess that Kishiko will come back with some opinions from the pro's
 AlexG 5d: guess b. couldn't play p11
 tof NR: great, kobayashi. but i didn't know that kobayashi's wife is kishiko before... :-(
 kobayashi 9p: Interesting isn't it:)
 tof NR: sorry if a bad joke "-)
 jjs NR: some one is younger than his wife?
 zhuge NR: kishiko = an4 zi3 i guess :)
 Cheng 6d: k13?
 zhuge NR: an4 = river bank.
 Vampire NR: k13 is good
 AlexG 5d: I like k13
 jjs NR: l14?
 Watch NR: if k13 b m13?
 Cheng 6d: so my kibitz make a sense
 ajiko NR: B K8 is severe
 barry 4d: j13 is a n interesting idea for w
 lounela 3d: w k13 should put w in the lead on points.
 watanabe 4d: I think w has to play k8
 kobayashi 9p: zhuge: Takagi = high tree
 zhuge NR: you're right -- i said high bridge?  WRONG! :(
 barry 4d: w wants to play g10 but needs a strong followup on left.
 magnus 2k: k13 makes miai of j15 and k8 IMHO
 zhuge NR: although my Chinese Pinyin was right. :)
 kobayashi 9p: zhuge: Kyonari = clear + becoming
 lounela 3d: j15 not that big.
 zhuge NR: oops.
 AlexG 5d: i agree with magnus
 tof NR: where did u get those, kobayashi? Kishiko back?
 blowfish 5k: how big would h7 be for black?
 lugq 2d: g10 after q11 and r11
 Vampire NR: k13 also for o15
 zhuge NR: then i couldn't recognize who Kyonari is.
 kobayashi 9p: Kishiko is back
 tof NR: no wonder
 zhuge NR: and more comments?
 kobayashi 9p: According to the pro's W will loose if he doesn't do anything special
 tof NR: now please
 AlexG 5d: s14 rather than o15?
 ding 1k: how about f9
 zhuge NR: honto? (that is, 'really?' :)
 zhuge NR: W is losing?
 nic 14k: we remain out of sync with the pros
 kobayashi 9p: White has no time to relax...

;B[ie]C[
 AlexG 5d: f9 is strengthening b.

;W[ne]C[
 watanabe 4d: good guess

;B[he]C[
 barry 4d: b j125 was very quick.  I would think for hours about that.
 jjs NR: from j15, j15 is big?
 watanabe 4d: reason I don't like k13 is because j15 affects 3 stones above
 gandalf 1k: hmm the cut now? looks intersting
 watanabe 4d: but looks like an overplay
 AlexG 5d: j15 was amust
 watanabe 4d: I agree - black had to play j15
 watanabe 4d: but now 3 white stones have only 4 liberties
 watanabe 4d: may make it easy for black to settle himself
 watanabe 4d: then white looks very think
 watanabe 4d: I mean thin
 barry 4d: Black has a small lead in territory. W still has good thickness.
 magnus 2k: after the cut is s14 sente now?
 barry 4d: W must be careful not to fall behind.
 AlexG 5d: if w. gets pts. inthe center he wins?
 watanabe 4d: I don't think white will get points in the center now
 zhuge NR: are we looking at a 0.5-point game?
 jjs NR: w wants m13 and k8?
 watanabe 4d: not after black thrashes around in there
 willfor 8k: what is black's next move?
 ajiko NR: if stone at Q13 gets safe then w has plenty of territory.
 AlexG 5d: s14 is a cente and the game is close

;W[gd]C[
 zhuge NR: b is threatening w's center.
]
;B[kg]C[
 barry 4d: will w sacrifice his 3 stones at top?
 ajiko NR: I think b will lose a group.
 barry 4d: no
 nic 14k: h13
 zhuge NR: okay a typo.
 barry 4d: surely b has to play at o14.
 AlexG 5d: w. is forced to defend an open-ended position
 zhuge NR: if b insists to get in the center, will that influence his left team?
 ajiko NR: YES
 zhuge NR: so maybe f10 is better than h13?
 ruebezahl 25k: the tree stones around j16 ? never!
 lugq 2d: b wants to survive well goes to the center
 AlexG 5d: o14 may be unneeded
 ajiko NR: b might play a neighboring point later for eyes.
 lugq 2d: o14 thretten the b in the upper side
 watanabe 4d: black probably wants to work out in detail
 watanabe 4d: how he is going to live now before playing
 barry 4d: b has to think of the overall result and how he is going to win.
 ajiko NR: Do all group run toward ponukis
 AlexG 5d: b. has 46 points
 zhuge NR: folks, what an experience to think along with the pros!
 Vampire NR: b l13
 jjs NR: b's right and d-r are too big
 AlexG 5d: w. has 34+komi+the center
 zhuge NR: really?  so if w gets 10 points at the center, he will surely win?
 AlexG 5d: yes
 lugq 2d: m13
 JW NR: k18 will give w another 6 pts at least.
 AlexG 5d: Ilike m13
 jjs NR: lunch time again?
 zhuge NR: not yet; maybe in an hour.
 kobayashi 9p: lunch break is 1:10 from now
 Cheng 6d: o14 may havas to go
 zhuge NR: i hope kobayshi will report what they eat for lunch. :)
 jjs NR: i huess zzzy's kinitz is off
 jjs NR: guess
 AlexG 5d: there are larger moves than k18
 jjs NR: kibitz
 JW NR: w may save k18for later
 kobayashi 9p: According to "mars" it's still very close
 gandalf 1k: who is 'mars'?
 kobayashi 9p: W = 48.5
 zzzy 6d: who is mars
 kobayashi 9p: B = 52
 zhuge NR: hmm that *is* close.
 kobayashi 9p: "mars" didn't calculate any points for the white center
 jjs NR: why k18? d17 is less than k18?
 tof NR: he is also there, jansteen?
 AlexG 5d: I was more conservative in the pt count
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, mars is in Amsterdam
 daniel 3k: b j13?
 zhuge NR: so w needs to make at least 5 points at the middle; doesn't look difficult. :)
 zzzy 6d: how do you know w 28.5 at this moment
 ajiko NR: I think the last B-W exchange was premature.
 tof NR: u guys r really having fun :)
 gandalf 1k: again. who is 'mars'?
 zhuge NR: mars is a good German player.  type 'stats mars' to see his stats.
 tof NR: a 5d in Germany, for those who don't know
 mk 3d: mars = jupzup?
 zhuge NR: yes.
 tof NR: mk=? :)
 mk 3d: mk < mars
 jjs NR: tof=?
 kobayashi 9p: Wer bisst du dann?
 nic 14k: stats mars: address - none, info - none.
 tof NR: if k=kilo, then mk >>>>> mars :-)
 zzzy 6d: see you
 zhuge NR: okay what's jansteen talking about?
 barry 4d: Ta shuo le "Ni shi shui?"
 zhuge NR: kobayshi has spent 15 min on this move now.
 AlexG 5d: I think there is a consensus about how much w. needs in the center
 zhuge NR: i see.  thanks barry.
 kobayashi 9p: Sorry zhuge, should be "tell"
 ajiko NR: B has to get a couple more points just to have eyes.
 zhuge NR: does everyone konw what happened yesterday at the end? (i mean to the net)
 nic 14k: no, what?
 AlexG 5d: you don't count those pts.
 zhuge NR: how to say: berkeley local net is blocked from outside, so only bpeople in berkeley was able to log on IGS (a total of 3).
 ajiko NR: If you dont then the score is not relevent (the group dies)
 zhuge NR: hopefully it won't happen again today.
 Vampire NR: seems that there is no blood today :)
 nic 14k: there's the French server too.
 AlexG 5d: are u sure it's not the lunchtime
 kobayashi 9p: No, Kobayashi is pondering deeply now
 zhuge NR: yes: how was the server in France at that time?
 JW NR: Vampire is so thirsty now... :)
 AlexG 5d: thanks
 kobayashi 9p: Lunch break is one hour from now
 barry 4d: It is hard to find a good way to attack the 4 b stones on left.
 os 3k: The French server was ok, but only ~10 people on.  They showed a few more moves of the game
 Vampire NR: kobayashi think what to eat for his lunch?
 JW NR: blood, i geuss.
 barry 4d: If b gets to play b6 then d6 and f6 he can live easily.
 zhuge NR: if the players like fried rice i can cook some and send it to them thru  SuperExperss :)
 jjs NR: blood is for drink
 barry 4d: so w must attack with b7 if stronger in centre.
 zhuge NR: better yet, i can send the fried rice thru e-mail. :))
 watanabe 4d: you mean b8
 blowfish 5k: { ||||||||||||||||||| }
 barry 4d: b8 would be an attempt to kill.
 JW NR: why not through Fax machine?
 jjs NR: use tell is faster
 watanabe 4d: well, then b6 is better than b7 I think
 watanabe 4d: wonder what the players are thinking
 barry 4d: Ok so how does b answer b6?
 AlexG 5d: g10
 barry 4d: I f black plays on edge then probably at b8 but b10 is dangerous.
 barry 4d: g10 might not work if w becomes a bit thicker in centre.
 watanabe 4d: I agree - I think white needs more stones toplay b8
 JW NR: agree with barry.
 lzy ???: e10 seems a good point for black.
 JW NR: can b settle k15 group in sente then play f10?
 barry 4d: So if w gets to play in centre (say g10) then b6 is good attack?
 watanabe 4d: but I think black has another way out - what about g7?
 AlexG 5d: I think the group on the upper side is weaker
 barry 4d: I was assuming b would play at O14 to look after other group.
 kobayashi 9p: b has to do sthing for the upper group ( may not be sente ) (mars)
]
;W[nf]C[
 AlexG 5d: o14 is slow
 barry 4d: If b plays g7 he is connecting on dame. w must be happy with that,
 Vampire NR: :)
 watanabe 4d: but means he can let group sit while takes points elsewhere

;B[kh]C[
 watanabe 4d: o14
 watanabe 4d: if otake did not play o14 he would not be otake
 barry 4d: o14 is fighting spirit. If b doesn't play there w shows why o14 was threat.
 zhuge NR: otake made this move fast, or did two moves came at the same tiem?
 JW NR: s14 becomes w's sente now.
 jjs NR: good for w
 watanabe 4d: also o12 is sente
 zhuge NR: and p13 is severe.
 AlexG 5d: I don't understand o14
 JW NR: plus k15-group still not settled yet.
 AlexG 5d: too costly in the center
 watanabe 4d: very costly
 barry 4d: w is definitely behind on territory now.
 Vampire NR: w could not make many points in the center
 barry 4d: must catch up through attacking.
 watanabe 4d: not costly if black stones captured :)
 zhuge NR: that's must be what otake has in mind.
 AlexG 5d: what stones?
 JW NR: but b j9 has always been there.
 watanabe 4d: k15
 barry 4d: b must play in centre possibly k12.
 jjs NR: no sotones
 lzy ???: I think w is ahead now.
 AlexG 5d: capturing k15 is science fiction
 jjs NR: w wants to gain something through attacking b's 2 weaks
 zhuge NR: 45 min from lunch break -- i am hungry now. :)
 watanabe 4d: o14 looks like a stake through a vampire's heart
 jjs NR: w might thinking that he cant make a big center, why not get s14 sente?

 JW NR: hahaha can never be early.
 kolian 4k: and here is like in Holland:) 11:30
 jjs NR: its 4:20am here, i just had my lunch
 watanabe 4d: k12 I guess
 mk 3d: j13 and then?
 watanabe 4d: didn't think that far :)
 lzy ???: l12 is strongest move for b
 jjs NR: if b k12, w would go j13
 lzy ???: but very risky.
 jjs NR: b still got to strugle for survival
 lzy ???: white is interested in capturing now.
 JW NR: i can see otake smiling now.
 deanr 3d: I doubt white can capture the center group - but how about the small group on the upper right?
 magnus 2k: for real or in your imagination?
 jjs NR: while there some w stones around h12, c9 will be the target
 zhuge NR: and kobayshi asks him, 'what's so funny?' :)
 AlexG 5d: who will have the last laugh?
 JW NR: 'cause you are suffering....
 lzy ???: the problem is b has two weak groups, not one.
 watanabe 4d: but group on left is not so weak
 kobayashi 9p: Sorry, somehow lost connection
 barry 4d: what no moves while youwere away?
 kobayashi 9p: However, nothing happened yet om the board
 watanabe 4d: didn't miss much ...

 zhuge NR: copyright has to be considered.

 tornado 2d: if u use xigs, u can save the moves on ur disk

 jjs NR: the problem is : got to go
 os 3k: What about mail *after* Asahi Shimbun has published the game?
 zhuge NR: that will be okay i guess.
 watanabe 4d: thanks for telling me about teh save moves !!
 gandalf 1k: why don't u read the message of the day?
 barry 4d: probably better to put it on R.g.g  to save the mailer too much work.
 kobayashi 9p: That's right, but we'll ask Asahi to be sure about it
 gandalf 1k: try 'help motd'
 deanr 3d: I think black wishes quiet settlement for his center group so that he can save group on left.  Upper right is also at risk
 willfor 8k: copyright can't stop me from remembering the game and I doubt there's any copyright on the kibitzes here on IGS. :-)
 zhuge NR: that will be the copyright of IGS! :)
 watanabe 4d: but it's not in xgoban format :(
 os 3k: What does 'local time' mean in the motd?

 zhuge NR: if Asahi Shinbum is interested in our kibitzing, they have to ask us. :))

 gandalf 1k: sorry local time = server time
 gandalf 1k: try 'uptime'

 tornado 2d: however, easy to write a script to convert it into smart-go
 barry 4d: smart go and mgt use the same format.

 deanr 3d: perhaps s14 and a move near n13...
 barry 4d: w would like to play at l14. needs a bit more strength in area first.
 zhuge NR: the next move will take 2 hours. jjs. :)
 watanabe 4d: anyone got a conversion file to convert from save moves format to mgt format?
 AlexG 5d: I don't see the point of k12
 AlexG 5d: what is n13 for?
 zhuge NR: s14 is sente, gains territory too.
 Vampire NR: s14 too early... how about h13?
 AlexG 5d: I take it back, n13 might be needed after s14
 deanr 3d: h13 looks interesting for w
 kobayashi 9p: A though position it seems
 zhuge NR: yes indeed.  but i don't see why h13.  tutoring please. :)
 deanr 3d: is kobayashi receiving our kibitz messages, or is that someone else entering??
 jjs NR: n13 does nothing to help s14
 zhuge NR: jansteen is entering for him.
 kobayashi 9p: No, kobayashi can read ur minds :)
 deanr 3d: n13 may help place pressure on the top group.
 AlexG 5d: Ithink b. is safe on the top
 Vampire NR: if not h13, w can play j12
 deanr 3d: after additional pressure on the top group, the stone at q13 beomes stronger and s14 becomes huge
 Moffen 16k: Are the other games to be played in Japan?
 barry 4d: a black move at j9 would be decisive>
 kobayashi 9p: That's right, the other games will be played in Japan
 deanr 3d: barry had found an excellent move
 watanabe 4d: what excellent move?
 Vampire NR: this is w's turn
 deanr 3d: barry suggested b J9
 deanr 3d: yes, it is white's turn.  Barry is suggesting a lurking threat
 AlexG 5d: maybe it's time for b6
 ruebezahl 25k: do they have a break now ?
 zhuge NR: wish someone in japan can do the same work as jansteen and AshaiRey.
 kobayashi 9p: No, no break yet
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, zhuge, that would be great!
 zhuge NR: break is 10 min away?
 Vampire NR: w may want to put stones around e9/f10 while attackting upper b
 barry 4d: The problem with that is that they travel around Japan.
 zhuge NR: maybe ishida 9p is interested. :)))
 kobayashi 9p: :):):)
 jjs NR: '7 minutes to the break, cant see the next move before leave
 barry 4d: In Japan there is a gonet which is acommercial operation.
 zhuge NR: poor jjs. :)  class today?
 jjs NR: no class, office hours at 11
 zhuge NR: TA or RA?
 deanr 3d: I need to wake my children and prepare them for school soon.
 JW NR: i think a game 'ishida-khuang' on the server would be interesting.
 jjs NR: Ta
 jjs NR: who is ishida?
 AlexG 5d: I've a poker game tonight
 JW NR: otake will just leave for break without playing next move.
 billf 10k: how long is the lunch break?
 Vampire NR: TA = Talking Assistance
 zhuge NR: an hour i guess.
 barry 4d: I think w will play at j12.
 kobayashi 9p: Lunch break is one hour, 5 min from now it starts
 jjs NR: good guess, Vampire
 deanr 3d: Bye.  Thanks for the company
 JW NR: he certainly does not want to give w extra time to think
 nic 14k: so next w move will be sealed?
 zhuge NR: that's still better than RA, the running assistant. :)
 barry 4d: they don't seal a move for lunch
 zhuge NR: no they don't.
 kobayashi 9p: They just left for the break
 zhuge NR: bye jjs. :)
 JW NR: are you a good runner, zhuge?
 jjs NR: bye, folks, bye zhuge
 barry 4d: good bye all. I can't wait that long
 JW NR: bye-bye everybody.
 nic 14k: going to bed... bye
 zhuge NR: not a very good one, i use whellwheelchair like i used to.
 willfor 8k: how long is the break?
 Vampire NR: bye now, i will see you in your nightmare :)
 zhuge NR: hour break.
 zhuge NR: okay i will take a break too. :)
 tornado 2d: is there a smart-go manual on ftp.u.washington.edu....i browsed through the directory couldn't find any...poor man wanna to break to copy right law
 AshaiRey 8k: there is some doc in mgt.zip
 AshaiRey 8k: Together with an example mgt file this is enough info to understand it completely.
 tsand 2k: did lunch break start?
 AlexG 5d: yes
 tornado 2d: thanks, ashairey.
 kolian 4k: silence?
 fmc 7k: lunch time :)
 harec 22k: If black play p12, could he then take q13
 AlexG 5d: before s14 is played there is no need to take q13
 kolian 4k: AlexG: what's your counting?
 AlexG 5d: give me a moment
 AlexG 5d: b. 37
 AlexG 5d: w. 32+komi

 kolian 4k: Alex, btw aren't you from xUSSR?

 kolian 4k: zhuge: xSoviet Go player. My teacher:)
 AlexG 5d: thanks ,AshaiRey
 zhuge NR: i see.  where is he now?
 kolian 4k: AlexG: Do you know some former xSoviet players, who moved to Israel?
 zhuge NR: and where is AlexG?  Israel?
 AlexG 5d: No, I don't
 kolian 4k: zhuge: NO:(
 AlexG 5d: I am in Chicago
 zhuge NR: AlexG: really?  which school?
 kolian 4k: Alex: Is Matvey still in Moscow?
 AlexG 5d: I am in UFC, don't know about Matvey
 zhuge NR: UFC?
 AlexG 5d: Where are you colian
 kolian 4k: Very pity. I've nobody to play in Israel:(
 zhuge NR: i see, just saw your stats. U of C.
 kolian 4k: In Israel
 AlexG 5d: Which  city
 kolian 4k: Alex: I once knew one Gurevich in Leningrad. His name was Maksim. He changed his surname  to Frolov after.
 kolian 4k: Alex: Beer-Sheba, but Israel is very small.
 AlexG 5d: I don,t know who is Maxim
 kolian 4k: Alex: Do you know Vadik av
 kolian 4k: Vadik Havin!
 zhuge NR: why do you ask all these quetions about Russian people to Alex, kolian?
 AlexG 5d: btw how did you figure my last name?
 kolian 4k: zhuge: should  ask you?
 kolian 4k: Alex: Your login is gurevich:)
 zhuge NR: ask me?  the answer will always be 'NO' :)
 kolian 4k: Alex: So do you know Havin Vadik(Vadim). he is Matvey pupil too.
 AlexG 5d: I thought it was my friend who was logged in
 AlexG 5d: I don,t know him either
 kolian 4k: Who?
 AlexG 5d: whyte
 kolian 4k: pity. zhuge: I ask Alex, because his answers aren't always 'no'
 AlexG 5d: I met Matvey when he was supervising
 jon 4d: What is the latest comment from the game site?
 kolian 4k: when?
 AlexG 5d: Moscow team on the Russian Youth championship
 kolian 4k: cool. If could be a member of it:(
 kolian 4k: sorry if=I
 zhuge NR: then why didn't you kolian?
 zhuge NR: you were in Israel already?
 kolian 4k: because I've been in Israel for 2 years:):(
 AlexG 5d: that was 5 years ago
 zhuge NR: kolian: is it possible for you to form an Israel national team all by yourself? :)
 kolian 4k: zhuge: why not:)
 jon 4d: It takes two to make a team.
 kolian 4k: Ahh. 5 years ago I didn't play:)
 kobayashi 9p: Break is over...
 AlexG 5d: great
 kolian 4k: Ok. Let's stop.
 zhuge NR: oops -- my local system will have an 'automatic shutdown in 5 min' :(
 zhuge NR: don't know if it will be back. :(
 AlexG 5d: ???
 kolian 4k: I'll e-mail you a game record, zhuge.
 lixj NR: game record + tons of kibitz:-)
 zhuge NR: what did the players had for luc  lunch?
 kobayashi 9p: I have *no* idea :)
 sxc 6k: curried egg sandwich ... sente
 zhuge NR: what was that?  Holland roast duck? :)
 AlexG 5d: is Otake still thinking?
 jon 4d: How much time do they really have left?
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, after he drunk a cup of thea, he bend over and ponders again...
 lixj NR: another 5m for sushi:)
 AlexG 5d: thanks
 kobayashi 9p: Otake is 50 years old, and Koba is 40 years old
 xux NR: p13
 fmc 7k: shutdown in gote zhuge :) ?
 zhuge NR: yes but i got another account. :)
 zhuge NR: is the clock 'correct' now?
 kolian 4k: no
 fmc 7k: don't think so
 fmc 7k: as they didn't adjourn the game during lunch-break...
 kobayashi 9p: I just addtime 60 for otake, try "refresh"
 zhuge NR: i see.  thanks jansteen.
 zhuge NR: hey if any of them 'forfeits on time' on IGS. :))))))
 AlexG 5d: they,ve plenty of time still
 kolian 4k: And Jan will phone in hotel after to say who lost:)
 kobayashi 9p: Kobayashi looks very confident
 lixj NR: that is the trick:-) he always looks confident even if he is behind.
 zhuge NR: sure: kobayashi says that kobayshi looks very confident :)
 AlexG 5d: doesn,t he always
 christie 2d: What do people think about the position ?
 zhuge NR: how about otake.  smiling?
 AlexG 5d: very close
 zhuge NR: very close.
 kobayashi 9p: Otake is very busy with his fan, in his ear, on his head, below his elbow, in his mouth (!)
 jon 4d: Close, but w is ahead.
 zhuge NR: in his mouth?!  i thought he had lunch. :)
 AlexG 5d: how much?
 sxc 6k: curried egg sandwich!!
 zhuge NR: really? they had that?
 zhuge NR: the next move should be a crucial one.  IGSers had proposed h13 and s14 i think.
 xux NR: and p13
 kobayashi 9p: mars: maybe b10
 zhuge NR: okay.  hope these will help otake. :)
 xux NR: am I right to think that n11 group is disconncted from p7 group?
 gandalf 1k: as i've had lunchbreak as well: what the consensus on the score?
 zhuge NR: close.
 AlexG 5d: close
 otake 9p: Won't help me. I don't see these kibitzes...oops.
 gandalf 1k: adnavantage?
 zhuge NR: hahaha..
 gandalf 1k: black or white?
 blowfish 5k: who's ahead depends on who you ask
 kolian 4k: AlexG have counted: Black-37, White-32+komi
 ruebezahl 25k: otake shall we help you with some analysis ?
 gandalf 1k: hhmmmmm, sounds rather close
 kolian 4k: Right Alex?
 zhuge NR: boy isn't that a 0.5 point game?
 AlexG 5d: that's what I think
 zhuge NR: we will see a serious ending game today.
 gandalf 1k: alex, can u elabotate a little? how many points whrer for whom?
 AlexG 5d: b. upper right 8
 blowfish 5k: I still see black ahead by about 1.5 points. Its tight no matter how you count it.
 AlexG 5d: bottom 8, top 3
 AlexG 5d: right28, oops off by 10
 zhuge NR: okay that gives you 37 for black.
 AlexG 5d: w. upper right 13-14
 tsand 2k: no, 47
 zhuge NR: no right side is 18 not 28.
 blowfish 5k: b= 8+3+8+28=47
 AlexG 5d: upper left 5-6
 AlexG 5d: lower left 10
 gandalf 1k: zhuge the right is even bigger than 28
 tsand 2k: I don't understand how u can get only 18
 zhuge NR: why only 18 on right Alex?
 AlexG 5d: bottom7
 zhuge NR: sorry, it *is* 28?
 kolian 4k: b=8+3+28!
 AlexG 5d: It was 28, sorry
 xux NR: bigger than 28
 AlexG 5d: b. has 47
 blowfish 5k: and you only count 37 white? hmm.
 zhuge NR: okay so b has 47+
 tsand 2k: komi..
 gandalf 1k: thanx alex so w would need some ten points in the middle without giving banything. tough
 zhuge NR: so tough for w now.
 zhuge NR: does that mean w O14 was questionable?
 AlexG 5d: w. has also 2 captives and komi
 kobayashi 9p: Otake is extremely restless, and seems uncomfortable
 zhuge NR: what's the sum for w now?
 blowfish 5k: so black, 47, white 37+2+5.5=44.5.
 AlexG 5d: I didn't like o14
 zhuge NR: hmm, but it's w's turn.  very clse.
 gandalf 1k: blowfish. but thats assuming white get s14
 lixj NR: white is not so bad.
 AlexG 5d: b. has no more than 28 on the right
 nic 14k: w 43.5 according to Alex' enumeration
 gandalf 1k: alex: well if white gets s14, or am i misstaken there?
 zhuge NR: w S14 would be sente, but w probably won't make it now.
 kobayashi 9p: agree, at this moment it would be aji keshi
 xux NR: doesn't w have to worry about o11 group being cut from o14 group?
 tsand 2k: how long has ws been thinking?
 AlexG 5d: s14 should be played soon
 blowfish 5k: and does the count make something like j/k17 big? I know its early, but is it big enough?
 kobayashi 9p: On this move: over one hour
 SteveC 2k: - does p10 make s14 much bigger - i.e. black must take s14, white plays p9
 zhuge NR: o11 group could either connect oto o14 or m9 i think.
 mk 3d: b cannot cut because w o12 is sente
 zhuge NR: over an hour?  must be the longest move of the game.
 kobayashi 9p: Yes, i think so too
 mk 3d: that's why w should save s14 until the attacking of b's middle groupd is finished
 blowfish 5k: its agreed that white has to pull off >something< spectacular this move :)
 gandalf 1k: white seems to be in for a tough endgame.
 AlexG 5d: don't forget that it's w. to play , while counting
 lixj NR: that could be worth 5pts.
 AlexG 5d: Otake might be 3 pts behind but he surely has 6= pt. moves
 kobayashi 9p: who's from Berkeley here on IGS?
 zhuge NR: me :)
 tsand 2k: 6pt _sente_ moves?
 AlexG 5d: no, gote
 xux NR: what would w do after b o13 w o12 b n13?
 zhuge NR: anyone else?
 zhuge NR: from berkeley?
 mk 3d: w n13 for b o13
 AlexG 5d: the sequence is unlikely
 zhuge NR: be back soon, folks.

 zhuge NR: otake is trailing the clock by 100 minutes.
 AlexG 5d: so what about e9 f10 j12?

 nimmox 6k: Does white play these moves ?
 gandalf 1k: when is the next tv-transmission? otake will time his resignation in accordance.
 AlexG 5d: What the hell is w. doing?
 zhuge NR: saving those two stone might not get the amount of territory he needs.
 kobayashi 9p: mars: false eye after B k12, W h14, B g13, W g14...
 mk 3d: i guess w is trying to make some points around f11 by playing g13 and f7
 lixj NR: definitely not saving two stones.
 nimmox 6k: is it an attack at the left side ?
 zhuge NR: i see.
 lixj NR: u think 9p is playing the way we play:-)?
 zhuge NR: he should.  once in a while. :)
 kobayashi 9p: Another note: B j11, W h14, B g13, W g14, B g12 ladder is blocked by W f9 (!)
 mk 3d: i see now why w played f9
 zhuge NR: so otake did find something in that hour.
 kobayashi 9p: right zhuge, we don't mind anymore the waiting
 lixj NR: exciting!
 zhuge NR: where does otake put his fan now? :)
 kobayashi 9p: They show the board now zhuge :)
 zhuge NR: jansteen, were those two sequences seen by mars?
 kobayashi 9p: right
 lixj NR: who is mars?
 zhuge NR: okay thanks mars then. :)
 nimmox 6k: Dutch ?
 AlexG 5d: b. might have too give up the 4 stones on upper right
 kobayashi 9p: mars: my pleasure
 zhuge NR: German 5d.  an IGS'er.
 lounela 3d: What's his real name?
 mk 3d: yes 5d, but he won 10(?) straight games against 6ds in IGS
 zhuge NR: something like that.
 lixj NR: there is a rumor that he is Shen Kuang-ji
 zhuge NR: no i don't think so.
 kolian 4k: but he isn't on Server. Is he there?(In Go Club?)
 os 3k: So IGS ranks play weaker than European ranks?  I find it easy here as 3 kyu too
 lounela 3d: Sheng Gruang-ji? He's no 5 dan, he's 6 dan.
 kobayashi 9p: mars: I'll take two stones from Sheng
 zhuge NR: well the ranks on IGS are not official, so you can't compare them with other ranks.
 nimmox 6k: what is IGS ?
 tsand 2k: what!?
 mk 3d: yeah, jansteen 3d also looks more than 3d
 zhuge NR: give me a break -- don't know IGS?
 kolian 4k: nimmox: IGS?
 kobayashi 9p: Internet Go Server
 os 3k: Don't dan players use their official ranks on IGS?
 zhuge NR: he's joking; i saw nimmox shouting played 49 games on IGS. :)
 zhuge NR: now 50 games.
 nimmox 6k: That was 49 on the server. And it is more now
 zhuge NR: IGS is the name of the server!!!
 nimmox 6k: American kyu players are weaker than european
 mk 3d: so b upper group in a big trouble?
 zhuge NR: could be.
 ruebezahl 25k: is sheng on now ?
 lounela 3d: Black had better have something good up his sleeve.
 blowfish 5k: now o14 is worth something :)
 zhuge NR: that fact is, some players on IGS use their offical ranks, some don't, and some don't have official ranks (like me :)
 nimmox 6k: What is wrong with k 12
 kobayashi 9p: shall i give you one zhuge?
 jon 4d: And some have two official ranks, like me.
 zhuge NR: what is it?  i have to be satisfied first. :)

 klooster 12k: thanks..
 zhuge NR: they had 8 hours (480 min) apiece at the beginning.

Black wins by resignation.

Commentary by JB & Olli Lounela.]AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]
;W[qf]
;C[OL: This is a good move, as it is well balanced in respect to the black stones at the corners above and below.]B[pj]
;W[of];B[nd];W[pl]
;C[OL: This is an interesting move. 
First, it is not bad at all. It makes white's Q8 look dubiously placed, and protects the corner quite nicely.

It is passive, however. Black will need to run to the center with Q10, and that can have unwanted adverse effects on black positions all around.]B[qn]
;W[fq]
;L[cn][nq][pr]C[OL: Here comes up the point that what it is that black wants.

I would prefer making smallish secure positions from which to harry white's unsafe ones, as black has four stones of handicap after all.

I would play black 'a' and if white 'b', black 'c' nicely leaves white overextended and vulnerable for invasion.]B[jq]
;W[fo];B[dn]
;W[mp]C[OL: A rather strange point for invasion, but not impossible.]
;L[mq][oq]B[nq]C[OL: This is downright bad. One should never, ever, ever play this kaketsugi \(shoulder-hit\) below without a very special reason and a clear knowledge that it is really bad style.

Here it clearly strengthens white by provoking 'a', whereas it does next to nothing for black's corner.

It would be far better to either leave this move unplayed \(probably the best choice\) or play at b.]
;W[mq]
;L[jn][kn]C[OL: This seems a bit slow considering that the white positions in both directions are rather far away. I would play either 'a' or, more likely, 'b', the latter of which also has the effect of attacking the two white stones to the right a bit.]B[jo]
;W[mn]
;C[I had pretty much decided that the last two moves were miai. Cap whichever white stones don't jump out. Seemed to be good.

OL: Good idea, and seems to work rather nicely.

I, however, would be bothered about the bad placement of O3 and the possiblity of a rather heavy attack on the black group in the middle bottom.]B[fm]
;C[OL: This is a typical tactic: a leaning attack aimed on the middle bottom group.]W[gm]
;C[OL: This I find slightly dubious.

While it is important to strengthen black's left side, pushing into white also strengthens white's group, and this in turn weakens the black group in the middle bottom. This looks like it were spelling a difficult fight for black.]B[fn]
;W[ho]
;L[jm][hq][gp][ip][jp][iq][ir]C[OL: Bad. Black whould first and foremost escape from the bottom in a good shape. Especially strengthening the attacking groups from the outside is not to be recommended.

I would rather play at 'a', only probably ater first forcing with 'b', which white seems to be forced to answer 'c'.

Note, that if white answers 'b' with 'd', the sequence to 'g' is to be expected, after which black's position has been substantially strenghened, besides which black would have poked himself out at 'a'. This would leave white weak and under attack on the side white would not defend.]B[gn]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[hn]
;B[hm]C[OL: This cut is foolhardy. Black stands a very real chance of getting killed in the middle bottom.]
;W[im]
;C[At this point, I thought that if white captured the 3 black stones in gote, the ponnuki and sente would be enough compensation, and that the 3 stones would still have lots of useful aji.

OL: The bottom territory, if white gets it, is actually rather large. In handicap game, I don't think the ponnuki would be adequate compensation. The aji left behind would amount to so little as to be almost nonexistent.]B[gl]
;W[in]C[OL: This I find bad.

First, it's a very bad shape.

Second, it does not even try to kill black.

Third, it offers black an easy way out.

I would play at 'a' and try to kill black by main force. That would at least force black to live with difficulty inside white's position, and that would surely cause damage to the surrounding black positions.]L[kn]
;B[lo];W[mo]
;C[However, this splitting attack seemed too good not to try, so I committed myself to saving the black stones. The white groups on both sides were weak enough to make it feasible, I thought. Plus I have some room on the bottom edge to play around.

OL: Escaping when offered a route this easy is natural. Black will have to be careful, however. The white group to the left is not as weak as it seems. Thus, black will have to concentrate on utilizing the weaknesses of the white group to the right.]B[km]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[il]
;C[I rather liked that combination. At this point, my prospects seemed pretty good.

OL: True enough, even if the stone at O3 looks clumsy. I would not enjoy being white in this position.]B[ml]
;C[OL: Aji keshi.]W[lm]
;B[ll];W[kk]
;C[That was a bit painful to connect, but "a" didn't work \(ladder broken\).

OL: This is not at all painful, I think. You should be laughing in joy and dancing around in little circles, since your opponent, a 3 dan, no less, goes ahead and helps you this way.

What really happens is that white forces black to securely connect where there were some weaknesses, and white gains nothing in the exchange. White's 'kikashis' are actually thank-you moves.

'a' does not work. Nevertheless, black really should force at 'b' first, so as to secure the connection further.]B[kl]L[jk][ln]
;L[om]C[OL: Very dubious. If black plays at 'a', the white group below will likely die, and that would be more than white can afford.]W[ok]
;L[om]C[Perhaps jumping out would have been better, but those 5 white stones are just too tempting.

OL: No kidding. 

Seriousy, though, the kosumi is a bit shaky shape here. I would prefer 'a'.]B[nm]
;W[oq]
;L[pq][nr]C[OL: This is bad. It's a bad idea and a bad way to do it.

First, black should not be possessed of the idea of killing. Letting white live small and taking territory and connecting securely would definitely be good enough. I would recommend 'a' instead.

Second, if black wants to save the single stone, 'b' looks better.]B[np]
;W[nr]
;L[or]C[OL: The other cut, at 'a', would seem better. The side is bigger than the corner.]B[mr]
;W[lr];B[or];W[ms]
;L[op]C[OL: 'a' is definitely better. The connection above is more important than a few points in the corner, which BTW would not be lost before white lives.]B[pq]
;W[kq]
;L[lj][pm][ql][nk]C[First big mistake. Induces an attack on myself!  Should have jumped to "a" probably.

OL: I would prefer playing at 'b', so as to secure the connection while threatening a connection below at 'c'. White would be almost forced to answer at 'd'.]B[oj]
;W[nk]
;L[on][pm]C[Getting a little too aggressive. My group is not quite safe yet. Playing something like "a" would have solidified a good lead.

OL: 'b' is still better. Furthermore, it will remain sente throughout the following sequence.]B[mf]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[ph];B[oi]
;C[Now it hits the fan.

OL: Right. It's now too late to dream about a connection. Now the only chance is to escape.]W[on]
;C[Another dumb move. Just induces white to attack me and strenghten himself.

OL: Right, and strengthen in a very bad way: white is making eye shape.]B[nn]
;W[no];B[lj];W[mj];B[kj]
;C[A leaning attack.]W[mh]
;C[Too big to give up now.

OL: And besides, fighting spirit makes escaping forced.]B[ng]
;W[lf]
;L[mg][lg][kg][lh][li][kh][ki][jh][ji]C[Bad shape. My thinking was that I didn't want to give white a sente play at "a". Maybe "b"?

OL: Yes, it is a bad shape, but it is probably the only thing to do. 'b' would only provoke 'a', and after black connects, 'c' would either give white ponnuki or seal black in with the sequence to 'i' in a most effective way. Bad shape is really preferable to that]B[nf]
;W[ji]C[OL: Just about the vital point.]
;C[More bad shape. But it looks like the only possible escaping move.

OL: Black should first force at 'a' so as to create a cutting point in white's shape. After that 'b' seems possible, as the cut results in a semeai between the white group to the right \(with few liberties\) and the black group.

However, the actual move does not seem to do any better. It looks like escaping is impossible, save if white shies from the semeai.]B[ki]L[jj][kh]
;W[jj]
;C[May as well make an eye, then.

OL: Yes. A good move keeping in mide the possibility of a semeai.]B[jk]
;W[kn]
;L[kg][lg][kh]C[Perhaps running out with "a" was wiser. Give up the bottom and then play "b" to hopefully make up for it on the right.

OL: Neither works as such. 'c' cuts anyway. That would result in the semeai mentioned before.]B[jn]
;W[ln];B[jm];W[kh]
;L[op]C[If I hadn't played the aji keshi earlier, white would not have an eye at "a" and my life would be much easier \(literally\).

OL: Correct. Now white has a spare eye there and so it is extremely difficult to survive this fight.]B[jr]
;W[hr];B[oo]
;C[Stopping any connection \(drat\)]W[om]
;B[op]
;L[lp]C[OL: 'a' seems to be a better eye shape.]W[ko]
;B[ij];W[jh];B[hj]
;L[dq][dr][iq]C[This move seemed a bit weak to me. Wouldn't something like "a" or "b" have been better?

OL: Thoughtless, I would call it. It looks like a typical way of reducing your opponent's liberties while maximizing those of yours. 'a' and 'b' offer more resistance, but I would think 'c' is best. As this is a semeai, it usually is of utmost importance to reduce the opponent's liberties as fast as possible.]W[ir]
;C[OL: A desperate attempt, but looking from the result, it is surprisingly effective.]B[gp]
;W[go]
;C[ rcn 3d: my stupid move at k10. should go k9 first

OL: Rather late for this comment... :-\)]B[fp]
;L[ep][eo][do]C[I thought white "a" would be more troublesome.

OL: I think you are right. If white 'a', black 'b' and white connection, it is clearly all over for the big black group. However, if black cuts below 'a', hell have trouble with shortage of liberties and several cutting points.]W[eq]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[ep];W[hp];B[dq]
;L[dr][cr][fr][ds][es][hk]C[I think "a" might have cooked my goose.

OL: Perhaps. The only realistic result I can see is the ko sequence to 'e'. That would probably be an improvement, since white has several local threats, beginning with 'f'.]W[is]
;L[kp][lp][lq][nl][gq]C[Threatens a-b-c and white would need an enourmous ko threat!

OL: While he has several, at 'd' for example, they are not nearly enough since black has more threats, starting at 'e' and playing out the semeai.]B[kr]
;W[kp];B[gq];W[gr]
;L[dr]C[OL: Even if the result is probably the same, 'a' is better style. It prepares to play tenuki, if need be. The actual move does not leave the same possibility.]B[er]
;W[fr]
;C[7 liberties and one eye each. SHould be a seki.

OL: It's more like 6 each, or 6 for black and 5 for white, but that's close enough to make it a seki.]B[dr]
;W[eo]
;B[en]C[A seki, but Black has most of the territory and influence, so white resigns.]

 White loses on time.

 Commentary by
    John Lamping, 1 kyu,
    Tero Sand, 2 kyu,
    and Olli Lounela, 3 dan.

 NOTE: shylock uses rank of
 29 kyu. When I asked, he said
 he is 5 dan.]AB[pd][dp]PL[W]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[nq]
;L[jp]C[TS: My first instinct 
would be to answer the kakari, probably at 'a'.

Then again, now that I look at it, this looks more dynamic.

OL: Well, this is more of a question of style. I played here to take the 
initiative, to take over the flow of the game. I still feel that 'a' would be 
submissive.]B[de]
;C[TS: Somehow this looks like what black wants; I'd 
play a hasami \(pincer\).

OL: It's actually OK for white to play this way. What white wants is sente to 
play in the bottom right corner.]W[ce]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc]
;B[ck]C[OL: 
This result is a kind of success for black, however. Black has made a moyo of 
the left side, which is what he was after, but then again, white is also 
satisfied, as he has sente.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp]
;W[kq]C[OL: This move I find dubious, lacking in shape. It's difficult to know what 
to do here, however.

'a' would be joseki, but 'b' on the right side is very attractive also.]L[mp][qi]
;L[oq]C[TS: Better than 'a'?

OL: Clearly. This more or less punishes white for playing the marked stone. 
Black's group is bound to be secure, and the marked stone is very likely to 
end up in an awkward \(position? place? shape? choose one\).]B[np]M[kq]
;W[mp]C[OL: Fighting spirit makes one want to play something else. I'd probably 
play at 'a'.]L[oq]
;B[oq];W[no]
;B[op]C[OL: This is a good result for black. 
The marked stone is now in bad shape. It should either be closer to the three 
stones, so as to make a strong shape, or much further away from them, say, at 
'a', so as to make the three stones light. Moreover, black's shape is strong 
and natural.

The game seems to be difficult for white; it now looks likely he'll have to 
kill something to win.]L[fq]M[kq]
;W[qi]
;M[fc][kq]L[mc][fq]B[iq]C[TS: My 
choice would be 'a', but it seems kind of slow. Maybe it even is made 
redundant by the marked stone at the top.

JL: Black attacks the weak White group, while getting a nice corner moyo.

OL: All this, and more.

Black is worried that if he doesn't do something in the bottom, 
white will extend to 'b'. That would actually remedy much of the awakwarness 
of the marked stone at the bottom.

Besides, black is thick at the bottom right. Thickness is best used by 
squeezing one's opponent against it, using it kind of as an anvil.]
;W[mm]
;B[ml]C[TS: This move I do not understand, but I'd venture to guess it's 
a tesuji.

JL: This keeps White from connecting.  The Black stone will either connect 
with the live corner group or get massive outside thickness.

But this move still looks like a mistake.  It strengthens both White groups 
while Black gets influence mostly facing toward the top, where it won't have 
that much effect.  I think that Black 'a', White 'b', to poke Black's nose 
out in sente, followed by Black 'c' would be better.

OL: Either this move is a big blunder, or it is a good tesuji, I'm still not 
sure which :-\) , but I'm very confident that it's good.

First, John's sequence is no good. The exchange of 'a' for 'b' is an obvious 
loss, as white's side becomes secure while black gains nothing, and 'a' does 
not make an attack at 'c' feasible.

However, this move actually is a tesuji.

What really matters here is that by playing this tsuke, black gets a 
connection into the center in a most efficient way; white is forced to submit.

Comparing the actual result \(up to 32\) with black's typical untesuji move 
at 'd' makes it clear just how much more efficient this move is.

It is gote, however, and lets white invade at 'e', but by my opinion, the 
fight that follows is feasible for black.]L[om][pl][io][nl][fq]
;W[nm]
;B[om]C[JL: Black threatens to cut at 'a'.]L[qm]
;W[pl]C[OL: This move is 
extremely hard to play; it's very, very painful.

White is forced to let black connect in an efficient way, simultaniously 
splitting white.]
;B[nl]
;W[lm]C[JL: White can't play 'a', because 
Black would play at the marked stone in sente, and get tremendous central 
thickness.

OL: And that thickness would spell B-I-G T-R-O-U-B-L-E for the white group 
below...]M[lm]L[ol]
;B[ol]
;W[fq]C[JL: Now White's group on the bottom is 
stronger, so White uses it to attack the lone Black stone.

OL: This is exactly what white would like black to believe.

The truth is, however, that it's white who's in trouble. He cannot sacrifice 
his group at the bottom right, it's just too big. But making eyes to it is no 
mean task either...]
;B[io]C[JL: Defending the weaker stone.

OL: More like splitting white.]
;W[fo]C[JL: White can't 
afford to share the corner first by trading 'a' for 'b', because Black might 
not answer in the corner, but rather play at the marked stone, connecting his 
groups and sealing off a huge moyo.

OL: Almost there, but not quite. Black would not play at the marked stone, 
since it is a bad shape.

But it is not easy to say just what black would do. One attractive 
possibility is 'c', making miai of attacking either group at the bottom all 
the while making a nice shape and ensuring an escape route.]M[fo]L[dr][cq][hn]
;B[dn]C[OL: Black's left side is just huge. White needs to do something 
dramatic to be able to win the game.]
;W[im]C[JL: This is White's only chance 
to cap Black.  Black's struggles to live or escape should strengthen White.

OL: I would call this white's only chance to try and stay in the game. If 
black settles the group in the middle bottom too easily, the game is 
absolutely over.

It does seem, though, that black's stones are in little trouble.]
;M[im][fo]C[JL: Playing at 'a' might seem more reasonable for Black, but White can 
make Black overconcentrated by engineering a trade with the sequence in 
variation B. Black would still need to spend another move to secure his 
corner.

OL: If white were to play as in variation B, black would happily play 'a' 
\(the reason is at the end of the variation\). What I wanted to avoid is in 
variation C.

Besides all that, this move actually aims at cutting between the two marked 
stones; there is a saying: "if you want to go to the left, go first to the 
right". The actual move is intended as a sacrifice if white cuts.]L[hm]B[jm]
(
;C[OL: I think this is an overplay. Black neatly and handily connects, 
and gets out, and white is left with an incomplete shape.

Besides, it usually is not advisable to fill in one's own liberties...]W[in]
;B[kp]C[JL: Black prepares to either make eyes on the bottom by capturing the 
marked stone or connect out to the top.]M[kq]
;W[jp]C[JL: This move prevents 
Black from making eyes on the bottom, to ensure that the group keeps running.

I think that it was a mistake, however.  If Black runs out, White ends up 
with two weak groups to care for.  Sealing Black off by playing at 'a' looks 
better.  Black will have to live on the side and won't get much territory, 
while White will get outside strength to ravage Black's side with moves like 
'b' and 'c'.

OL: This move is not a mistaek, it actually seems white's only chance to try 
and fight; see variation B.

However, black is largely untroubled. He but needs to connect out.]L[jn][cq][ch]
(
;B[jq];W[ko]
;B[jo]C[JL: Now White can't play 'a', or 
Black will play 'b' and capture one of the marked stones to become safe and 
strong.]M[kq][ko][mp][no]L[jn][lp]
;W[lp]
;C[OL: Now white is strong in the 
bottom right, but black has poked his head out.

The white group to the left is weak.

Black very much has the advantage.]B[jn]
;L[gn]W[fm]C[JL: If Black were 
allowed to play here, it would strengthen his moyo in sente.

OL: The actual thing might be much more troublesome; black hitting at the 
vital point of 'a' and cutting...]
;B[il]C[JL: Black starts to 
exploit the shortage of liberties of the two marked White stones.

OL: And makes absolutely sure of this group's safety besides.]M[im][in]
;W[hl];B[ho];W[gn]
;B[ik]C[JL: I think that 'a' would have been a 
better move for Black, because that would have prevented the middle White 
group from escaping toward the center, and allowed Black to connect his two 
groups together as the White group was making eyes.

OL: 'a' would be a mistaek. White would push to 'b', which aims at cutting 
black off the center with 'c', threatens invasions 'd', 'e' and 'f', and 
beyond all that just about secures the white group.

Black actually does not intend to cut the white group to the right off the 
center. No, he wants it to run so he can chase it and make thickness in the 
centre.

One actually would want to double hane at 'b', but no good would come from 
it. White would cut at 'a' and win the semeai against the cut off black 
group. ]L[jl][hk][kk][cq][ch][cm]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[kl];B[jl];W[kk]
;C[TS: This 
looks fragile.

OL: It *is* fragile, but black actually isn't attempting to keep white in.

Rather, he's trying to make white run out in a controlled fashion.]B[kj]
;W[jj];B[lj];W[jk];B[hk];W[gl];B[hi];W[ji]
;B[ek]C[JL: Looking good for Black.  
Black has sealed White, connected, and protected the weak spot at 'a'.  After 
White lives in gote, Black will be able to play in the upper right.

OL: Right. Black's strategy seems to be an enormous success. White has about 
35 points and black seems to have more than 40 and lots of potential for more.

There is, BTW, an another purpose for this jump. Black wants to make sure of 
a linkage, albeit a loose one, with the center group.]L[ch]
;W[hq]
;B[hr]C[JL: 
This looks like a mistake, because Black ends in gote.  Black 'a' looks 
better, because Black will end in sente and be able to make a big play 
elsewhere.

OL: This move is correct. If black played at 'a', white would descend and be 
just about alive. Black wants to keep white's group at least a little bit 
insecure, and make any connection underneath here impossible.]L[hp]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[gr]
;B[kr]C[JL: This looks like a mistake.  White can still make 
an eye in ko with 'a'.  Black 'b' would have taken the eye 
away absolutely.  I still think that playing on the upper side, maybe at 'c' 
would be better.  That looks like enough of a threat to White's center group 
to make it spend a move to form eyes, while Black stakes out a nice moyo.

OL: The actual move seems necessary. The point is all about security of 
groups.

'c' actually is one of the biggest points on the board, but it is not urgent 
\(it is an overextension, though, 'e' is better\).

What the marked stone does, is make it possible for black to make eye shape 
in the bottom, for white cannot afford to lose the ko following from 'a'. 
Thus, 'a' is not a real possibility -- yet. Also, the marked stone steals 
white's eyes.

'b' instead would be a mistaek, for white would later be able to play at the 
marked stone, and threaten to cut the center group adrift with 'd'. Black 
would be forced to answer and white would be guaranteed at least one eye in 
the bottom *in* *sente*, and thus the group would be fairly safe.

Now, instead, it's black who's fairly safe and white has to run through dame 
\(worthless\) points in the center.

The game is proceeding very smoothly for black.]L[lr][mq][jc][fj][kc]M[kr]
;W[nj]C[OL: White tries for a diversionary attack, but...]
;B[lh]C[JL: Black 
refuses to comply with White's forcing move.  The forcing move looks like 
it was a mistake, because now White's center group is in trouble.

OL: Right-o. Looks like black now really gets into stride; his groups at the 
bottom are safe, for he has 'a' in reserve.

Now white really seems to be in trouble.]L[lr]
;M[pj]W[pj]C[JL: I don't 
understand this move.  If White is going to play around here, 'a' looks 
better.  Is White protecting against some invasion that I don't see?

OL: No, quite the opposite. White is preparing for cutting at 'b'; it would 
be impossible without the marked stone.

White has no time to play at 'a', as his center group is in trouble. Black 
might yet find a way of seriously damaging white somewhere if white does 
nothing, but...]L[qf][mk]
;L[mk]B[lr]C[OL: ...black crawls once more.

This move may seem small but it is not. The large white group is absolutely 
without eyes \(well, OK, it has half an eye\). Crawling here also makes 
absolutely sure no connection whatsoever will exist for white, and 
furthermore prepares for a connection by black.

White really has to do something to his group now. And black is not worried 
about 'a'; he looks forward to harrying white's group and sealing off the top 
right.]
;W[jg];B[lf]
;W[je]C[watanabe 4d  Black seems ahead.  Black can 
secure the corner while forcing white to live in the lower left, and is also 
securing territory in upper right while attacking.

OL: White's preoccupation with 'a' seems very costly.]L[mk]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[kc]
;C[TS: With a weak group nearby, this does not seem to be recommended.

OL: This is true.

Black does not need to do much to win now. He'll just have to be patient. 
Even letting white to encroach bottom left would not be enough, but white's 
invasion is rash. He should not be able to live both with his group and the 
invading stone.]W[co]
;B[do]

weak groups.]
;B[dq]
;W[br]C[

;B[gp]C[JL: Black cuts the White group in 
two.  This move wouldn't have worked earlier, because the Black stones to the 
left weren't as strong.

OL: Yet it seems to be a mistaek, even if white answers.

Black should split white in two at 'a'. He should be able to kill one or the 
other... but then again. Most anything is good enough for black.]L[dr]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[dr]
;B[er]C[JL: I don't understand this move.  Playing at 'a' seems 
to be worth more points.  I thought that maybe the actual move threatened the 
corner, but it looks alive to me, even if White plays elsewhere.

OL: H'mmm. This move is dubious all right. Looks as if I was suffering from a 
lapse of concentration.

The reason to hane is to gain a stronger connection above. If black 'a', 
white connects and black needs to connect somewhere above. The idea of the 
hane is induce white 'a' and let black connect in a stronger way while 
killing the group above naturally.

However, I think the best black can do is 'b', leaving the hane as aji. But 
then again, that would irritatingly leave 'a' for white...]L[eq][go]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[ir]
;B[ib]C[OL: This move is not big, it is ENORMOUS. It makes black 
secure and takes lots of territory.

Black leaves the marked stones as aji.]M[hr][er]
;W[mr]C[
 watanabe 4d  next h16 is severe, and r13 is big

TS: 'a' severe? What does it do?

OL: The question is still about the safety of the big white group.

White either must make eyes or connect around 'a'. If he doesn't, black will 
attack very severely at 'a'.]L[hd]
;B[lq];W[mq]
;B[kp]C[JL: Gives White 
half an eye on the edge, but takes away half an eye in the middle.  This move 
is more profitable than 'a'.

still would be some worrying aji around 'b'.]L[or][fj]

This kind of move usually brings dread to one's opponents' hearts.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[bm]
;B[bl]C[JL: A mistake, as it turns out.  This leaves behind 
enough aji to let the marked White stones live in ko.  Just playing at 'a' 
looks better.

better than the one at 'a'.]L[eo]
;W[eo];B[em];W[fh]
;B[hn]C[JL: The 
ko amounts to about 30 points, more than Black's side, so Black finishes the 
ko.]
;W[ch];B[dh]
;W[bf]C[OL: This is the price black has to pay. He's still 
very much in the lead, though.]
;B[rh];W[qc];B[pc];W[rd]
;B[qb]C[JL: This move 
drives White out down the right side, but Black is a little weak on that 
side, so letting White live in gote with the sequence from 'a' to 'd', 
followed by Black 'e' looks better to me. 

OL: I still think this is correct. What black wants to avoid is a ko or a 
living group in the corner.

Besides, there's no way for white to live here after this hane.]L[re][pb][ob][rb][rj]
;W[rb];B[qd];W[rc];B[pb];W[rf]
;B[re]C[JL: Killing the 
four White stones is worth about 20 points, compared to letting White live 
in gote with the sequence in variation B.  Sacrificing the marked stone is 
worth it.

OL: It's also much, much bigger than would have been letting white live in 
the corner.]M[rh]
(
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[qh]
;B[gd]C[JL: Playing at 'a' is 
worth about 20 points for Black, but Black goes from some sente profit 
elsewhere first by threatening to cut off White's eyeless central group.

OL: Good timing.

Black's idea here is to test white's responses, yosu-miru. He wants to see 
what white does, and whether there is any sente profit available. But, as 
this area is not important for black, he can return to 'a' any time.]L[sf]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[gc];W[ci];B[ed];W[ec];B[ih];W[jh]
;B[bg]C[JL: 
Black plays a sacrifice stone to set up a shortage of 
liberties of the two marked White stones to set up a thick connection.

OL: Correct. Otherwise there would be lots of worries here, eg. the peep at 
'a'.]M[ch][ci]L[ef]
;W[cg];B[df];W[bh];B[di];W[hg]
;B[sf]C[JL: Now Black takes 
his profit, but this seems inconsistent, since Black still has more sente 
plays against the central White group, such as 'a'.

OL: The problem with 'a' is that it is not necessarily sente; white may yet 
find a clever way of living in sente.

Taking the profit is playing it safe. This is the correct attitude if we keep 
in mind that black is leading.]L[ff]
;W[sg];B[se]
;W[ff]C[JL: Now White can 
connect or get eyes.]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[ni]
;B[pi]C[JL: 
This looks like a mistake, since it lets White connect around the other side. 
The sequence from a to g looks better for Black.

OL: Black does not consider the two gaps as weak, since the white big group 
is still eyeless.

Anyway, John is right here. I made a misreading. But instead of 'a' black 
should play 'c' immediately.]L[nh][mh][ng][mg][mf][mi][lg]

;W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[jd]

;W[hb]C[This feels slack. It would probably be better to jump directly to G13.]
;B[eb];W[md];B[nc]
;W[ic]C[Bad style.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ia];B[lc];W[rd];B[qc];W[oq]
;B[ie]C[Not urgent, nor big. Black should immediately play a kakari \(approach move\) on the lower left corner.]
;W[gf]
;B[ep]C[Very, very big.]
;W[hp]
;B[dm]C[This is slack. Since black already has a stone at D10, which by the way makes a silly shape with D7, playing a tsuke underneath at C3 would seem better.

Also possible is C5. It might actually be the best move here.]
;W[en]C[An unusual move. Looks like white is trying to trick black.

There are josekis to this move, however, so it is not bad by itself. It just is not appropriate here.]
;B[go]C[Bad. This has to be at D5, which would guarantee at least reasonable result for black.

D5 is actually a joseki.]
;W[eo];B[dp];W[co];B[gp];W[cq]
;B[hq]C[Necessary. I get the feeling black has been outplayed here.]
;W[jp]
;B[ho]C[Bad. Must be at J3.]
;W[ip]
;B[fr]C[G2 is better shape. However, jumping to center, around H8, is probably best here.]
;W[ir];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[hr]C[This only strenthens white. Very bad.]
;W[jr];B[cn];W[do];B[bo];W[bp];B[bn]
;W[dq]C[This is a difficult move.

First, it is aji keshi. White will have to do something to compensate.

Second, it has an adverse effect on the eye shape of the white group.

So I would call this too risky, and not recommend such a move.]
;B[er];W[fp];B[eq]
;W[fo]C[White seems possessed of the idea of killing black. This kind of thing usually leads to a bad result.]
;B[gl]C[A strage shape, and loose. This net may not hold.

If it does not, it would definitely be better at H8.]

F8 is likely much better.]

;B[fk]C[Bad shape.]
;W[im]C[This result is almost the same as if black had played K7 at J8 followed by H9, G10, H10, E9, J7, but with an important difference: black would have been able to atari his way out, or at least have gained *lots* more liberties, at J6. Now white gets a wall of steel here.

;B[fn]C[First, this result is slightly better than if white had played D3, However, I judge the risk of E2 instead of C4 unacceptable.

Instead of jumping right away, black shoud atari at B3 first, since it is sente and fairly big.]

B3 should be white's sente, too. If not answered, it wjould leave black without both base and eye shape.]

;W[ed]C[E17 seems better. then if B E16, white would live in the corner with C18.]
;B[cd]C[A better way is E17, W F17, D18, G16 which leaves white with a lot less than this \(over\)solid connection.]

;W[ef]C[OL: This is slightly bad style.]
;B[fe];W[cc]
;B[cd]C[I feel the other block at 'a' is more appropriate.

OL: That is not true. The move black played is definitely correct and good besides.

If white goes ahead and connects at 'a', black has a move that makes life very difficult for white, at 'b'.

Furthermore, the two white stones below will be almost useless, and the excange of E14 for F15 will be made bad for white.]L[dc][eb]
;W[dc]
;C[OL: A good move, this makes a white escape from the corner absolutely impossible. White will have to make eyes.]B[gf]
;W[bd]L[gb][eb]C[I wasn't sure whether White could survive if Black played 'a'. In any case, even if he did, Black could seal off the edge that way.

OL: Only, 'b' is a better move than 'a' and the vital point here.]
;B[be];W[bc];B[cf]
;W[md]C[Too deep, too early? I was afraid the whole top would turn into Black territory - especially since the right side White group isn't alive yet.

Actually, it's close to not being a group, just 3 stones.

OL: This is a difficult point. The actual move looks too rash as it invites a double attack which would likely give black a huge top or an enormour right side.

However, it is not easy to know what else to do.]
;B[oc]L[pe][ng]C[Protects the cutting point at 'a'. Whether cutting is a realistic option for White is another matter.

OL: Right. It is very hard to know how to answer the cut, but basically the result of the cut should be good for black.

Another, and better option would be 'b', which separates white and threatens a very serious attack on either the side or the top. That would be the dreadful double attack. 'b' would be excellent for another reason too, as it connects the group to the center. After that the cut at 'a' would be no threat since living in the corner is no problem at all.]
;W[lf]C[I tried to come out in a way to not hurt the three W stones around R14.

OL: Trying to avoid the double attack.]
;B[ng]L[qg][qh][rg][rh][og][ph][re][rf][pe][sg][qi][ri][rj][rd][rc][sf]C[This makes cutting at 'a' a real danger. Actually, instead of O13, it might be effective to execute the cut-and-squeeze manouvre from 'a' to 'j', then attack the two White stones in the middle.

OL: Excellent, even if it makes P17 seem superfluous.

The suggested sequence to 'j' is not quite what should happen, as playing 'f' instead of 'e' would connect.

The real danger on the side is not the cut at 'a', as the sequence 'c', 'b', 'd', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p' would let white live. The move to create *real* problems is the peep at 'd'. It looks likely white would die.]
;W[lh]C[This definitely is going to hurt the right side group - I was trying to preserve the aji in the vicinity of 'a'.

OL: There is no aji around 'a', as a peep at 'b' solves all black's problems quite nicely.

Were I white I would try to settle one of the two groups absolutely as fast as possible. The attack from 'c' to 'g' looks like it wouls cause white a slight :-\) problem of being forced to leave the group at the top to die.]L[gd][kg][rh][qh][ri][oi][mi]
;B[ni]C[OL: This feels slack. A more active course would be called for.]
;W[pi]C[Something has to be done - or does it? Maybe I should'be left the stones there for aji...

OL: Or maybe you should just settele them fast. 'a' looks possible. The actual move just asks for getting sealed in. As long as black doesn't mind letting white towards left a tsuke of this kind is not recommended.]L[rj]
;B[qj];W[qi]
;B[rj]L[oi]C[As Black, I'd play 'a', letting White live \(?\), but getting a wall.

OL: The actual move is better, as black gets a wall anyway. White probably is not keen enough to die by cutting.]
;W[oi]
;B[ok]L[oj][ri][nh][nj][oh]C[This should be at 'a' - this lets White out.

OL: And worse, it lets all black's fine thickness go to waste. 'a' is definitely sente forcing 'b', and a cut at 'c' or 'd' would be no threat as black lives in the top right.

Furthermore, if black is worried about the cutting points, 'e' defends in sente.]
;W[nj];B[mi]
;W[mj]C[White is hallucinating - this should be 'a'. Now Black can cut.]L[oj]
;B[li]C[Black lets White off the hook - again.]
;W[oj]
;B[ol]C[I feel this is unimportant. Better to attack the three White stones.

OL: Not quite. The three stones are very hard to save anyway.

The black move is bad shape. It should be at 'a'. As there is the jump to 'b', the big white group is not out of trouble yet, and torturing it a bit in the future should be easy enough way to secure victory.]L[pl][rh]
;W[ri]C[OL: White tries to secure the group as running away only damages the top group.]
;B[rd];W[rg]
;B[ch]C[Same comments apply.

OL: Not quite. This move really is bad and a waste. Attacking the right side group at 'a' looks fruitful, as it seems likely that once without eyes, the group has to run at 'b' and struggle. Continuing with 'c' would force white to run to the left and leave black with an enormous bottom.]L[re][ml][mn]
;W[ig]
;B[gh]C[OL: Peeping at 'a' looks called for, as it puts white on the spot. White would be very hard pressed to make eyes or escape, and the double attack would probably continue.]L[kg]
;W[ii]
;B[kh]C[More severe than I thought.]
;W[kg]L[jf][jg]C[To preserve the connection, 'a' would be better. However, I thought I could either connect to the corner group or capture some Black stones.

OL: 'a' does not connect, as 'b' cuts nevertheless.]
;B[jh]
;W[ih]L[jg][he][ie][id][ic][gd][jc]C['a' might be better.. if Black then pushed through at J12, White might be able to do something with 'b'.

OL: It is very hard for white to do anything here. 

I would play 'c' as it seems to connect 'a' and also threaten a connection with 'd', 'e', 'f' \(black seems obliged to connect at 'g'\).]

;W[kf];B[lc];W[mc];B[lb];W[mb]
;L[jb][eb]C[OL: A clever move. I would be tempted to play 'a' instead and make eyes, but this atari is clearly much better.

Further, looks like black now is able to kill white's corner at 'b'.]B[gc]

;B[fi]
;C[OL: This move looks like bad style, but it's hard to know what else to do.]W[gj]
;B[ik]C[Even that seems to slip away...

OL: Excellent.]
;W[gl]
;L[ll]C[OL: This is no good, as it forces white to connect exactly where he wants.

It would be far better to play around 'a' which besides threatening to kill white's group above, also makes a connection of some kind and a huge bottom moyo. It also would throw gloomy \(and greedy\) glances at the white group to the left...]B[hk]

Black should first force at 'a' and then at 'b' so as to have any chance at all to win the capturing race, but even so, the race looks bad for black.

;W[pl];B[rn];W[pq]

;B[pp]C[Starting in this corner is traditionally considered unpolite. Should be at Q16.]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[pi]
;W[dj]C[Answering the high chinese fuseki \(which is what black has\) with a san-ren-sei is brave. All too easily a game turns into a moyo contest.]
;B[jp]
;W[jc]C[4th line, at K16, is slightly better.

But, actually, playing at the middle of the top feels unimaginative. I'd first play at N16, forcing Q15, then either J17 \(which is probably best\) or K16.]
;B[mc]C[This feels slack. It would be better to punish white by exetending to the limit, at M16. If white responds to K15, white's moyo would be too open and thus easy to invade.

Playing N17 makes it all too easy for white to invade at R15.]
;W[je]C[The golden opportunity for the invasion at R15 is now. Even if white only played one single stone in top right, black would still be hard put to find a reasonable answer. After black's response to this jump, invading the top right will be that much more difficult.]
;B[le];W[qn]
;B[qk]C[Better to play below the single white stone, preferably at S5.

This stone only forces white to strengthen his stone and attack the corner, and furthermore, it does not really defend the upper right.

If black played at S5, the likely continuation would be W S9, B S10, P9, O11, and the top right would be almost territory.]
;C[Good. Now it will be hard for black to make use of R9.]W[np]
;B[no];W[mo];B[oo];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]
;C[I would think this move too dangerous, although white seems to be just about as much in danger. Generally, this trick move is not to be recommended.]B[oq]
;W[op];B[mp];W[nq];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[po];W[rp];B[ro]

;B[so];W[nm];B[om]
;C[Good style.]W[lo]
;B[kq];W[ol];B[pm]
;C[This move is a bad shape. While there are several options as to what to do, this definitely is not among the best of them.

The moves to consider here are M7, M8 and O8. Of those, M8 looks the most interesting and the best shape.]W[ml]
;B[pl]
;C[If only white had played a better shape to the right, this would be unnecessary. There are bigger moves at F3 and C15.

But actually, considering the black moyo at the top right and the weak white group floating in the center, a move at O11 looks most attractive. Not only would it strengthen white's group but also reduce black's moyo.]W[jn]
;B[fq]
;C[Bad. Strenthening black here means trouble for the floating white group.]W[fp]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[dq];W[cq]

;W[cr];B[do];W[ep];B[cn];W[bp]
;C[That this situation is a ko means that black has badly erred here. The ko is a hanami-ko \(nothing to lose\) for white since he can always connect at E3.]B[bo]
;W[co]
;C[This just goes on to show how meaningless black's moves after F2 were. One wonders whether F2 was a typo.]B[cl]

;C[ Having to make extremely sure eyes for white in gote spells disaster for black. He is not yet even close to living.]W[ao]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[dm]
;C[Very good. The top left looks like developing into 100-point territory.]W[bi]
;B[bk]
;W[fk]C[Dubious. Surrounds the centre too slow.]
;B[fl]
;W[gk]C[Bad. This is not sente against the group to the left. Better to leave F9 as a kikashi and surround the centre in a large scale, e.g. at J11.]
;B[in]
;W[ho]C[Bad. The moyo at the top left is still the most urgent area. White should defend it and ensure a big enough part as territory. That would seal the victory.

It would also be possible to prevent black's moyo and attack on the lower right center white group by playing O11.]

;B[kn]C[Good.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[jl];W[im];B[ll];W[kk]
;B[lk]C[Capturing the white stones to the right was rather large. The game is no longer clear-cut.

Actually, it looks like white is trailing by lots. White will need a spectacularily large top left to have a crack at winning.]
;W[lm];B[kj];W[jk];B[jj];W[ik];B[ko];W[lj];B[mk]
;W[li]C[Good.]
;B[nj]
;W[jh]C[Better at L13.]
;B[kh];W[ki]
;C[Good. Now black only needs to reduce white's top left to win, preferably by living in there. Black's top right should be big enough to guarantee victory, however, even if black dies in the upper left -- but he'll need to be very careful.]B[mh]
;W[cc]C[Excellent.]
;C[K14 would be good enough, and less risky.]B[ec]
;W[gc];B[ei]
;W[dg]C[Better at E9. There's no way black might live on the left side. E9 would, furthermore, seem to be sente against the black group to the left and below.]

;B[dc]
;W[bb]C[Clever.]
;B[eb];W[gb]

However, the dying sequence in the upper left means that black has given white quite a few points. The game is again getting fairly close.]

;C[This is not a good idea.]B[ma]

;W[cj]
;B[cd]C[Black is following a slightly dubious strategy. He plays any which way without regard as to the co-operation of his stones or coherency of position.

I would prefer 'a', which continues the mokuhazushi \(3-5 point\) strategy, 'b' making territory, or kakari at 'c'.]L[jc][jk][ej]

;B[ke]M[ke]L[jk][ek]C[I eould prefer 'a', which makes miai of the marked stone and 'b'.]
;W[ec]C[Good.]
;B[dc];W[ed]
;B[ek]C[This is very bad style.

If one plans to play tenuki at the top left, exchanging the marked stones is \(clearly :-\) a loss. If, however, black makes the excange, continuing with 'a', 'b' or 'c' is obligatory.]L[df][cf][cg]M[dc][ec]
;W[jk]C['a' is much better and the normal move, but actually, since this is a small board game, I would be sorely tempted to play 'b', which actually looks troublesome for black.]L[ce][be]
;B[cl]
;W[cg]C['a' is the only move. The actual move leaves black unpunished from leaving the joseki unfinished.]L[ce]
;B[kk]C[Should be at 'a' to secure the bottom group.]L[hk]

;B[li]C['a' is learly much better. Black has nothing to fear from white's hanetsugi at 'b'.]L[jj][mk]
;W[je]C[Good. Black looks like he were going to be overconcentrated.]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[kc]
;W[de]C[Now 'a' really looks good, since the marked stone just about forces black to answer to 'b'.]L[be][bd]M[cg]
;B[ce]C[Black should be very happy with getting this push, since he no longer has bad aji in the corner.]
;W[eg]C[This should probably be at 'a'. Also attractive looks the hane at 'b', which would create a threat of 'c'.]L[cf][kb][kf]
;B[bg]C[Small. Should be either 'a' or 'b', which look just about equal in size -- and thus should be miai.]L[jb][jf]
;W[bh]C[Also too small. The top right corner is the big one.]

;W[bl];B[ck];W[bj];B[ch]
;W[fk]C[Dangerous. What will happen if black pushes at 'a'?

If white 'b', allowing 'a' is a loss, and also leaves an annoying cutting point at 'f'. Starting with 'g' reverts to this after black 'c', W 'b'.

If white 'c', the cut at 'd' would seem to work -- if white 'e', black 'f' gives *lots* of threats for the ko and liberties for the semeai against the corner.]L[ej][ei][fl][di][dh][fi][el]
;L[ej]M[fk]C[While it is very difficult to say if black should have pushed at 'a' \(even if it *does* seem to work\), answering meekly makes the marked white stone a good move. I would definitely feel uneasy for submitting so. It seems to be lacking in spirit.]B[fl]

White: Will Chen 1-dan

Black wins by resignation.

23-Apr-1992

Commentary by Olli Lounela.]AB[dp][pd]N[\(igs\) WillChen\(white\) vs. tsand\(black\)]
;W[po];B[dd]
;W[fq]C[Strange. White's bottom position is without coherence, since Q5 is very high and F3 is on the 3rd line. R14 would be more natural, and probably better.]
;B[dn]
;W[jp]C[Again incoherent. White's bottom stones seem to be co-operating very little.

I would play J4 and leave the bottom right to fend for itself for a while and leave it to black to try and find a suitable spot for invading, which is not an easy task.]
;B[cj]C[The right side is more important.]
;W[qf]C[White gets the big point.]
;B[nd]
;W[pj]C[This move makes it clear just how importand the right side was. Now white's position is much more coherent and harmonious than it would have been had black taken the right side.]
;B[pq]C[This move proves the case and illuminates it all the more clearly. White has erred and been forgiven.

The point is that this invasion gives white an easy choice of how to repair any defects in the moyo by attacking the lonely invading stone.]
;W[oq];B[or]
;W[op]C[While it is hard to say, I think O3 might be better. The outside is more important than the corner.]
;B[nq]
;W[nr]C[Still going the worng way. Better to cut on the other side, white is being too greedy in mapping out the corner as his.]
;B[mr];W[pr]
;B[ns]C[This ponnuki seriously weakens the white position to the left.]
;W[qq];B[mo];W[fc]
;B[jc]C[Good. J17 would be better balanced, though.]
;W[cf]C[Creating a symmetric situation here is dubious. Black is given too easy a choice as where to play.]
;B[ee];W[cc]
;B[cd]C[Ironically, both sides are absolutely equal in size, width and value. The choice between C16 and D17 is a toss of coin.]
;W[dc]
;B[gd]C[Good, putting a little pressure on white. G15 would be too slack, as it would make no use of the low position of K17.]
;W[bd]C[Aji keshi. It would be much better, although a bit painful, to submit and play G17, and then tenuki.]
;B[be];W[bc];B[ce]
;W[gc]C[After keshing the aji and killing C14, white goes ahead and plays here anyway. Omitting the hane-tsugi in the corner would have been much better.]
;B[hd]
;W[cl]C[Too deep an invasion. Black gets a perfect opportunity to reinforce and enlarge the moyo above. The corner is in no danger at all.

White probably should play around E10, or better yet, reinforce his bottom group.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[el]
;W[bf]C[Bad aji-keshi. It is very likely white will come to regret forcing black to defend here by taking points.

Later white will probably wish he had left the chance of playing A15 for later.]
;B[ae];W[bj];B[bi]
;W[em]C[This does not quite work.]
;B[dm];W[ek];B[fl];W[dj];B[ck]
;W[ci]C[White is adopting a dangerous strategy. It is not clear if white can live between the black side and the wall, and white's initial investment by sacrificing the side below is rather large.]
;B[bk];W[bh];B[aj];W[dh];B[ej]
;W[ei]C[If white has to resort to living in ko, he has made an enormous mistaek here a couple of moves ago, thus the folly of deep invasion is clearly proved.]
;B[fj]C[Trying to kill the whole thing. Very difficult but seems vaguely possible.

Note, BTW, how the white group in the bottom looks all the time more and more forlorn.

The game is going well for black.]
;W[fi];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi];W[hh]
;B[fg]C[Nice timing. Also serves to connect the gap above.]
;W[fh];B[ii]
;W[eg]C[Looks like white will have to live in gote. That would be sad news for white's bottom group.]
;B[ff]
;W[dq]C[Extremely dangerous, for white's group in the middle left is very close to dying.]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[eq];W[dr]
;B[er]C[Excellent choice, trading the corner for the \(enormous\) side.]
;W[ep];B[fr]
;W[do]C[White, of course, realizes that giving up the side would be quick way to lose. However, his \(possible\) life will be very difficult and black will get lots of profit.

Black is clearly winning.]
;B[cp];W[co]
;B[eo]C[Good timing for a kikashi cut. White is getting ever deeper into trouble.]
;W[fp];B[br]
;W[bq]C[Looks like white can't decide what to do. He's playing here and there but not really getting anywhere.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[gr];B[ds];W[en];B[fo]
;W[cm]C[This is bad. The bottom group is *MUCH* bigger. And besides, getting eyes here is not nearly guaranteed, much less easy.]
;B[go];W[cn]
;B[al]C[Looks very much like a killing blow.]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[fs];B[cs];W[gl]
;B[gq]C[Good. Removing worries here makes attacking the group above that much easier.]
;W[hm]
;B[fk]C[Again tidying loose ends, and preparing to play a ko at F6.]
;W[fn]
;B[in]C[Now it is clear jush how big the bottom is, and that 'big' is almos unbelievable. The game seems to be over, since black can start a ko at D11 any time.]
;W[jl];B[kn]
;C[White seems to regret his choice of abandoning the bottom, but too late.]W[hq]
;B[hp]
;C[While this seems to be the vital point for anything here, that anything does not exist. This means that white is all the time giving black more and more points. Not recommended.]W[mp]
;B[np];W[no]
;C[Good style.]B[nn]
;W[oo];B[lp];W[mn];B[lo];W[nm]
;C[This is bad style. It would be far better to start harrassing the white groups on the left side. Particularily, starting the ko at D11 would leave white in shambles since his weak group below can be used as an unlimited source of threats.

Now black only gives white a chance to reinforce himself by attacking the lone stone.]B[ol]
;W[nk]
;C[Big, but not nearly urgent.]B[rd]
;W[of]
;C[Good, even if attacking the white group to the left seems accidental.]B[mf]
;W[re];B[qd];W[hk]
;C[White should not delay but start the ko at D11.

Somehow I get the feeling that black feels too relaxed to give the knock-out punch.]B[jg]
;W[gj];B[bl];W[ah];B[ai];W[ih];B[jh]
;C[Cutting here means that white's groups are going to be securely connected. So much for the knock-out.]W[ji]
;B[ki];W[jj]
;C[Now that the game has been made drastically closer, even if it is not close yet, black has to start trying once more.]B[pg]
;W[pf];B[pi]
;C[Bad style. Normal style would be either O12 or S12. Here O12 does not work so S12 is mandatory.]W[oh]
;B[oi]
;C[Bad. Living small accomplishes nothing.]W[ph]
;B[ni];W[qi];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[om];W[pm]
;C[Black should connect at P6 first, as it is rather large sente, aiming at something like M8 or M10, the latter of which makes J14 unnecessary by making it impossible for white to play at J14.]B[if]
;W[on]
;C[Black should play O13 first.]B[hc]
;W[jm];B[jn];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[lh];W[lg];B[lf];W[kg];B[kf]
;W[ng];B[kh];W[mj];B[mi];W[ne];B[me]
;C[This looks too greedy.]W[nc]
;B[oc];W[md];B[od];W[lc];B[ob];W[ib];B[hb];W[jb]
;C[N18 looks more like the vital point.]B[kc]
;W[kb];B[ld];W[mb]
;C[Luckily for black, omitting the vital point is not bad enough to let white live.]B[nb]
;W[gb];B[ha];W[mc];B[ma];W[lb];B[kd]
;C[This is silly, and there's no way this could work.]W[rb]
;B[qb];W[rc];B[sd];W[qc];B[pb];W[qa];B[pa]
;C[Q1 would be bigger.]W[km]
;C[Better to play Q1 immediately.]B[lj]
;W[lk];B[ps];W[qr];B[qs]
;C[S1 is bigger, even if little painful.]W[hf]
;C[White should play S2 in sente first.]B[he]
;W[gf]
;C[This kikashi is better left omitted. There are bigger points, and furthermore, it only loses sente.]B[gg]
;W[hg];B[ge];W[ef]
;C[White finally resigns.

It is interesting to see how much panicking can cost. White invaded too deep in the left side and got right into trouble, which spread to all parts of the board.

Also interesting is to see how much can be lost by missing the most important move, taking the ko in the left side.]B[fe]
