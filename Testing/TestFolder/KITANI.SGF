Comment[Go Seigen (Wu) vs. Kitani

(The 1st Japan's Strongest Deciding Matches)

Black: Kitani Minoru, 9d

White: Go Seigen (Wu), 9d

Date:  April 14-15, 1957

Place: Tokyo]
;
Black[qd]
Comment[(* Before WWII, in Japan, the most popular stars in sports were led by Futabayama of sumo [Japanese wrestling\], Kawakami of baseball, Boriguchi of boxing, and Kimura Meijin of shogi.  While in Go, the most honorable, at the top of the world, were none other than the discoverers of "new opennings", Kitani Minoru and Go Seigen [Wu\].

(* [Now it's post-war time.\] Those famous stars [excluding Wu and Kitani\], at one time or another, have either retired or faded, and only the home run king of baseball, Kawakami, is still able to live up with his fame; he is a rarity.

(* But Wu, since traveling to Japan in 1928 at the age of 14, has held the highest honor in Go, never faded in 30 years. He is truely a genius that would appear only once a few hundred years in Go history. *)]
;
White[dc]
Comment[(* Comparing with competitions in which outcome may be decided in a short burst or a split of second, a Go game takes much longer battles to yield a winner and a loser.  This may have told us why Go players' professional careers are longer than that of other sports. *)]
;
Black[pq]
Comment[(* After WWII, Kitani's record was down for a while, but since he was promoted to 9 dan last year [1956\], his once unbeatable form has re-appeared.  Recently he posted an astonishing record of 14 wins and 5 losses.  In major tournaments like the Highest Rank Deciding Matches, Honinbo Matches, and Tokyo Newspaper sponsored Championship Matches, he all recorded triumphs. *)]
;
White[oc]
Comment[(* Is the once overwhelming "Wu-Kitani Era" re-emerging?  Gradually recovered, rising giant Minoru Kitani, challenges Go Seigen for the first time in 13 years.  This balanced struggle is indeed the most remarkable post-war battle since the Wu-Fujisawa 10-game series. *)]
;
Black[cp]
Comment[This is the first game between Kitani 9 dan and me [me = Wu\] after the War.

Before the War, we had a 10-game series when we were 7 dans; later, we also played 4 games.  I remember these 4 games were three games in the Grant Meet (Nihon Kiin's [Japanese Go Association\] ranked players tournament) and one game sponsored by Yomiuri Newspaper.  Finally in 1944 [during the War, that is\], we met again in the ranked players tournament when we were 8 dans.  This game now is my first against Mr. Kitani in 13 years.]
;
White[po]
Comment[This game is played in Tokyo Chiyoda District Kioi Street's Fukudake Inn on April 14-15, 1957.  At the same time, the game between Sakata Eio 9 dan and Takagawa Honinbo 8 dan [another of Strongest Deciding Matches\] is also held here.  That game of theirs will end with Sakata 9 dan, playing Black, winning by 4 points.]
;
Black[pp]
Comment[B #7 [Q4\] is Kitani 9 dan's unique move; other players rarely play it, but Kitani 9 dan has used it a few times in openings like the 1-3-5 [R16-Q3-C4\] of this game.

B doesn't want to play B[a\] so that W would play [Q4\] to form the "avalanche shape", so [Q4\] move applies the proverb "opponent's key point is also my key point."]

Comment[B #49 [F17\] is very good.

At first sight, [a\] seems to be the real big point for #49.  But if B[a\], W will certainly presses at [F17\].  Then the B teams at upper and right sides would yet have enough eyes, and with two "floating" teams, B would be difficult.

Moreover, now with #49, B creates an opportunity for B[b\] to attack W.]
;
White[ck]
Comment[Since B gets [F17\], [C9\] big point is left for W.]
;
Black[gq]
Comment[And then B #51 [G3\] becomes clearly the next biggest point.

B #51 could also consider to play at [N6\] [see an earlier reference at move #47\], but that would make it complicated, so B #51 "cashes in" with some territory first. [I guess Wu is saying, since B is leading, no need for him to make it complex.\]]
;
White[mo]
Letters[mn][pm][pn]
Comment[W[a\] for #52 is a correct [text\] move, but if W does play [a\], it would be no threat to B's corner [see reference at move #38\].

Also, if W[a\], B[b\] to force W[c\], and B[d\] would give B a clear lead.

Therefore, even though [N5\] for W #52 is not solid, W doesn't have many choices.  This is again the fault of #38 [O6\].

W #52's purpose is to force B repond here, so W can get sente.

Comment[If B ignores here, see variation. Therefore, B #53 [M2\] and ...

Comment[...[and\] #55 [N2\] are necessary.

In short, in order to get sente, W has to make a move like #52 [N5\], although it would leave some weak point.]
;
White[nj]
Comment[W #56 is the key point to attack.  No matter what, if W doesn't stick with this B group, W will have no way to win.

#56's purpose is to gain opportunities to protect cut at [a\] by attacking B team.  Conversely, B can adopt two difference attitudes, either harder or softer, when he chooses his next plays.  In short, this is the first crisis of the game.

Comment[After B #69, *if* W can gain with [a\], seemingly sente, then turn to left side, that would be even better for W [than to turn to left directly\]. See variation.

[But Wu said that [R7\] wouldn't be a sente move for W now.  I thought, "Hey, why bother? [C6\] is big, get it first anyway." But the fact is, in this level of games, *every* point is important.  If one passes by a sente move, it could be not sente later.\]

Anyway, W finally gets the chance to occupy the big spot at [C6\], and thus escapes from the previously disadvantageous situation.

At the right side, if B[b\], W[c\] cut would take care of it.]

Comment[B #107, and the right W team is dead.  However, I think with the moyo at the middle, W has more than enough to compete with B.

Therefore, B #103 [B12\] was a questionable move.

In this picture, W G16 [marked\], extending out, gave W's central moyo a big boost in thickness.  So B's best policy at this point was to shift the emphasis to the middle, damaging W's attempt to control the center. Consequently, B #103 should play as in variation.
