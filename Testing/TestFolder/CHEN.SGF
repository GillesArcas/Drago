The New Physical Education Cup, China's oldest newspaper title, has been
discontinued after 14 years, but thanks to the efforts of the Chinese Ki-in,
a new title has been founded to fill the gap.
The new title is called the Da Guo Shou Tournament, which means something
like the National Championship Tournament.
Da Guo Shou is a traditional term for a great champion and at one time was
confered on Go Seigen by Taiwan (he refused the more exhaulted term of
qisheng - kesi in Japanese - which means "go saint" or "go sage").
The new tournament is a four round knockout in which 32 players nominated by
the Chinese Ki-in compete.
The big news of the first tournament was the successful comeback of Qian
Yuping after an absence of close to two years.
Qian forfeited the final of the 4th Fujitsu Cup to Cho Chikun in August
1991; according to the Chinese side, he was suffering from headaches.

C[Chen is known for his originality and his dislike of sticking in the
professional rut.
Here he puts his own flavor on the game very quickly with the unconventional
combination of 26 and 28.
He succeeds in cutting off a group to chase.

C[The game turns into
an ordinary endgame,
so we have omitted
the remaining moves.
Moves 151 to 248
omitted.
The result is a 1/2
point win for Chen.
This game certainly
shows that Chen,
approaching his 50th
birthday, is still a
formidable
competitor.
Unfortunately, we
don't have any
information on how
he's doing in other
tournaments.
