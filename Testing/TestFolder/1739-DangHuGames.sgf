Hi everyone!

It's an undeserved honor but a great pleasure to present a series of
Ancient Chinese Go games here.

The games were played in the year 1739, when my great great great
grandfather was openning a small tea shop somewhere in Southern China :).
The two players, Fan and Shi, were among the most famous ones in Chinese Go
history.  Their fighting strength are said to be stronger than some pro 9
dans of today, and they were called, fittingly, "great national hands"
(ever heard of an artistic term for "playing go" -- "hand talk"?).

Both players were born at a same county, which was exactly the same place
where these game were played.  The county was called "Ping Hu", also known
as "Dang Hu", and these games were concequently called "Dang Hu Games."

In this year, 1739, Fan was 31 years old, and Shi 30.  Both were at their
prime time.  These games showed their extraordinary skills and imagination;
these games were not only the Go Bible of those days, but even today, they
are regarded as the best classic work of Go in China.

They played more than 10 games, but it seems to be a tradition that people
prefer round numbers for important collections.  Today, for example, they
have the annual "top ten news of the year", and fans vote for the "top ten
athletics of the year", etc. in China.  Same thing happened to these "Dang
Hu Games"; people later only collected 10 of them.

But aren't 10 enough?  I think every single game could bring us enough
excitement.  To make it a lasting event, I won't post 10 games altogether;
I will post one game every two or three days. (Hey that's a good excuse.
The truth is, I just finished the editing of the comments on Game 1 :-)

The comments are based on a book written by Chinese pro 9 dan Mr. Chen
Zu-De, who was once the number one Go player in China before the younger
Nie.  My translation could be full of mistakes (which many people can't
find :-), and for those who *can* see the mistakes, I will be greatly
appreciated if you point them out.

Finally, actually most importantly, I wouldn't have started to do this if I
were not inspired by players on IGS (Internet Go Server; if you have not
heard it, I am sorry you have missed an half year of fun).  In fact, to
express my special thanks to people (related to Go) who have greatly
influenced me, I will dedicate each editted game to a person (anyone on
IGS, watch out :-).

Enough said.  Better read the games than my words. :)

jzy, NR ^_^

Comment[
Here is the first of 10 commented Dang Hu Games I am going to post.  As I mentioned, each game will be dedicated to a person that has helped me to improve my Go and that has inspired me to do this work.  I wish I can do more than 10 games since people I want to thank are definitely more than 10. (BTW, I might not reveal this person's real name, since I might have never seen him before, but only get to know each other through IGS -- so, I will use his name on IGS if possible.)
This first game is dedicated to *jansteen 3d*, who has posted quite a few games here (Honinbo, Tengen, etc.).  What I am doing is nothing but to follow his footstep.

Comment[Game 1

White: Shi Xiang-Xia

Black: Fan Xi-Ping

Date: 1739   Place: Dang Hu


Four stones are placed on the board \(as shown\) before the first move \(white\).  They are called "seated stones."  Because of these "seated stones," the opening of ancient Chinese games were rather simple and dull.  However, the midgame fights became extremely violent, and ancient Chinese players were good at fighting.]

Comment[
Hi, everyone.

Here is the 2nd game in the Dang Hu series.

This one is dedicated to *panx*!  My "brother" on IGS :-)  Panx was clearly
the best among the kibitzers, and his commentating was so attractive that
we have missed him badly since he "disappeared" from IGS.  Yes, he will be
back, but sooner the better.

An interesting observation: panx' real name, Pan Xiao Feng, has initials of
pxf, while one of the two great players we introduce here, Fan Xi Ping, has
initials of fxp.  So, pxf and fxp. :-)

Where are you, brother?!

This is due to the different Go philosophy: Today, players would hate B to peak at C17; those days, however, players would rather have a "bad shape" of stones, they wouldn't let opponents to easily settle down \(note D18's effect on B F18 group\).]

Globally, however, B lived all the stones at the top side \(quite a bit of territory\), and B gains sente \(remember W played first\).  So B should be satisfied.]

Comment[So W wisely chooses W H3 and L3 as the new targets.]
White[ho]

Black[qq]
Comment[W has to make a decision here.  If Q3, B S3 and the corner becomes B; also, the B group at the right is easily settled.  Then W has to bet all his money on the attacking upon H3 and L3.]

White[qp]
Comment[W obviously can't make up his mind \(to give up attacking B Q7 group\).  With this R3, Q3 exchange, B O3 would be powerful.]
;
Black[nq]
Comment[Now, if W plays O4, then \(B first\) N2, O2, P3, M2, and B P4 would force a collapse of W.  If W plays N4, after B N2 and W M2, B has a good move in P2, and W's corner would be killed.  If W plays another variation at M3, W would still fail after \(B first\) O4, L4, and Q3.]

So they would play till the end. \(No comments rest of the way execpt an overview at the end.\)]

Comment[Black wins by 15 1/2 zi.

Overview: althogh each player made some mistakes, this is still a great game.  W 105 turned a black corner white, but B came right back with a great move 124.  Wonderful game.]

Comment[
Hi everyone!

I have received a few suggestions thus far.  Thanks a lot.  However, some
changes will not be made immediately (such as adding some variations) since
it will take too much time.  My plan is to post these games first, and
re-edit the comments and add variations in the future.  When *that* is
finished, I will probably submit these commented games to milton ftp site.

This is the 3rd game, and this game is dedicated to *ychen 6d*.  He has
been a good friend I made on IGS although we've never met.  I respect him
not just because he's one of the best players on the server (in fact, I
wasn't so happy when he beat me up :) but also, he is one of the nicest
person around.

If ychen 6d had the honor to play Jiang Zhujiu pro 9 dan's first game on
IGS, then I had the honor to play *his* first game on IGS. :-)

Comment[Black wins by 14 1/2 zi.

Overview: W grabbed an early lead.  But in the battle at the upper left corner, W 59, a huge mistake, gave B the chance.  B thereafter played better and better, looking like a complete different player from the "first half."

Quite a few good moves in the game.  However, casual moves like B 68, B 86 and W 87 left some "spots on the jade."]

Comment[
Hi everyone!

This is Game 4.  It's dedicated to *dfs 6d*, who gave me the first
impression how a real strong player plays.  True, I had some Go books
containing some pro game records (which are supposedly better), but to see
it really happening, to see it move by move (LIVE :), i first experienced
it when watching a dfs game on IGS.

Of course, dfs is not a pro and he doesn't play pro game either.  But had
he been a pro, i wonder if i ever had the chance to make him a friend. :-)

Comment[W R14 and O17 are called "double birds" \("double flying swallows" in Chinese :-\) These two moves initiate a typical joseki in ancient Chinese games \(this joseki is still quite common today\).]
;
Black[pf]
Comment[Shi, in one of his book on Go theories, explained the direction of B #12.  If O16, after W N16, B O15, and W P17, W will be able to play K17, a good point since it salso presses B F17.  Therefore, the correct direction for B #12 isQ14, as Fan played here.]

Black[of]

White[qe]
;

White[md]
Comment[This move can be also played at R16, then B should P17.  However, ancient players, who preferred "potentials", almost always played N16 here.  Today's players are probably in favor of R16 -- therefore, today, B would play R16 \(instead of O16\) to prevent W \(Note if W plays Q15 after B R16, B would give up P14 and Q14 and swallow W O17.  B would be better\).]

Comment[Some readers must question this: what if W plays R17 now.  After B Q17, W has S16 to get the corner.  Yes, you're right.  But again, ancient players preferred potentials \(relatively speaking, of course\).  Since B has N17, he is not worried by W R17.]

White[qh]

Black[rg]

Comment[R13 is correct.  If P13, after B O14 and W S12, B has a very good point at K17.  Now with R13, W doesn't give B chance to play K17.]
;
Black[mf]
Comment[Necessary.  If omitted, W has O15 and O13 to cover B with *sente* -- if B ignores W O13, W has S19 to kill B corner with a ko \(that's the reason W didn't make the "favorable" exchange of W O19 and B Q19\).]
;
Comment[Key point.

It would be quite common today to see B to play C17 next.  However, Fan and Shi never played 3-3 invasion under this situation.  Not only a 3-3 invasion here doesn't fit their style, but also, at that time, the way of scoring was different --]
White[ic]
;
Comment[At that time, experts realized two eyes for each group were the minimal condition to live.  Therefore, each group should leave two eyes \(2 points\) to be not counted.  As a result, more groups a player had more than his opponent, more points it would cost him.  And a 3-3 invasion could easily create an "extra group" for his own.]
Black[fe]
;
White[ef]
;
Black[ff]
;
Comment[From today's point of view, to play this move at E13 is enough, since no matter how strong B \(potential\) is here, W's top group is not in any danger to be attacked.  Yet Fan and Shi thought E13 instead of F13 would be "weak."]
White[fg]

Comment[B lost his last chance.  Should play O2 so that W's lower right can't live without winning the ko.  Although this doesn't mean B can turn it around, but such a possibility would then exist.  Now B has lost for sure.]

Comment[Hi everyone!

This is Game 5, which means we've reached the half-point.  That's worth
celebrating, isn't it? :)  Therefore, this game should be dedicated to
someone special, like someone that everyone on IGS would like to thank.
Okay, this time, this "someone" is *tim*, who has been the "Keeper of the
Server."

Thanks, tim!!

And personally, I have this special memory of being kicked out once from
the Server by tim. :-)

Comment[Strong move.  Shi explained: if W plays O9 instead, B would have J5 and B would be better \(W corner is not clean\).  W O9, Shi continued, would be correct only when R11 is at P14.]

;
Black[nj]
;
White[oj]
Comment[W P9 and P10 look mediocre, but W really can't go with other choices.  Q7 \(instead of O9\) seems to be a move to defend here, but the result isn't quite clean -- B has S6 to live the corner.]

Black[qn]
Comment[Slightly late.]
;
White[rn]
PLayer[W]
Comment[Now if B plays R5, W S5 is good and B can't live here.]
;
Black[ri]
Comment[W has to be careful here.  If W casually plays S12, B has Q11 sente.  After W R12 and B O11, W has to play M9 and B would have a good move at Q7.  That would be a big headache to W.]

Comment[The corner is not settled.  However, if B plays the corner now, although he could create a ko or live with seki, he doesn't have ko threats or, with seki, he would lose sente.  So a better choice for B is to play somewhere else.]

Comment[Urgent.]
Black[oi]

Comment[Let B to save a few stones \(R9 etc.\).  Smart choice.  If W plays Q11 instead, B now can live the corner with seki *without* losing sente -- B would have Q8 \(now Q8 is not a threat because of W R4\).]
White[qp]
;
Comment[To here, W gets 20 plus points at the lower right.  B gains some outside potential, but this potential has been damaged by W M9.  Plus the faulty B S11, it can be judged that W is leading.]

Comment[If W plays this move directly at J5, it's already W's advantage.  L2 is tight, leaving little breathing room for B.

Editor: L2 is not just good; it's deep.  Chen 9p used nine variation diagrams to explain why L2 is good.  Unfortunatly, I am unable to include all these variation here since gasoline today is so expensive. :\) Hope I *will* be able to include them when I re-edit these comments.]

Overview: B had some loss in the lower right corner fight.  With the resulting advantage, W frequently attacked B with tight and clever moves.  Although B fought very hard, there was no chance -- W's calculation was flawless, good moves were endless, and his attacks were breathless.  Fan's masterpiece.]

Comment[Hi everyone!

This is Game 6.  This time, I would like to thank another "keeper of the
server," only this time I am referring to the server in France, the first
IGS outside U.S.  Although that server has not been as active as lacerta
(New Mexico) nor icsi (Berkeley), it has served many players in Europe
well.  So, thank you, *fmc*, this game is dedicated to you.

Comment[Black wins by 9.5 zi \(19 pts\).

Overview: Although both sides have questionable moves, good moves are remarkably remarkable. :\)  The spectacular fight around the upper right corner, and B #160 \(N6\), are moves that can't be thought of by ordinary players.  Shi and Fan were truly "great national hands."]

Comment[This is Game 7.  After tim and fmc, people on IGS are probably expecting
*tweet* next -- yes, this game is dedicated to *tweet*.  Who's tweet?  Let
me put it this way: tweet to IGS is like the Godfather to the Mafia. :-)
He was involved in the establishment of all three existing Go servers, so
it's not surprising that tweet knows everything on IGS.  And tweet knows
everything on IGS for one single reason -- he does his best to serve everyone.

Thank you, tweet. *bow* :)

Comment[Invasion to initiate a fight.  So far it's almost the same as Game 6, which was won by Shi \(played B too\).  It's understandable that Shi preferred the same openning, but Fan also decided to go with it -- he was of course prepared.  For example, an exchange of W P14 and B N17 \(more pressure on B R9\) before W M3.]

;
Black[eq]
Comment[B does not play P2 but plays E3 instead, showing his aggressive attitude.  W Q2 hoped B to play P2 but failed, so later Fan improved this move once again: W would play Q2 right after W L4, then, without B K4, K5, and J7 stones, B is not strong enough to attack W left, so B would have to play P2 and W Q2 would get what he wants.]

White[er]
;
Black[dr]
;
White[fr]
Comment[Although W E2 and F2 were common plays, but not appropriate under this situation.  Fan, playing W, later preferred E2 and E4 \(not F2\) to gain outside thickness, while Shi preferred W H3 \(not E2\), B F2, and W G2.  Both disagreed with W's plays in this game.  Now B has sente.]
;
Black[en]
Comment[Attack, but somewhat "shallow."  B D9 would be good.  Then W C2 \(after B D9\) is good order, followed by B C3, a text move.  After that, \(W first\) D1, D3, F7, and C8.  Although B corner is hurt, he gains quite a bit at the left.]

Comment[White wins.

Overview: At the beginning, B's attack at the lower left was successful, thus B began to lead.  B's mistakes \(#70 and #86\), however, cost him the lead.  W played very well afterwards: #93 and #95's sharp attack, and #99's great thinking put W on the winning track.  Later, during W's invasion to B's left and B's invasion to W's top, both players showed tremendous skills.  A spectacular game indeed.]

Comment[Hi everyone!

Game 8, and two more to go. :-)

This game is dedicated to our dearest *UFO 30k*, probably/perhaps/maybe the
"strongest 30k" in the solar system (he once claimed to be from Mars :-).

That's not all about UFO; he's one of the most special because he was the
organizer of IGSWCT '92.  The tournament offered a great chance for players
to meet some opponents never faced before, and thus to make more friends on
IGS, so it was probably one of the most precious experience for many of the
participants.  But this would have been impossible without our
"UnForgettable Orginizer."

Fact: IGSWCT '92 had a total of over 300 games, while an NFL (pro football)
regular season consists only 224 games. :)

Nice job, UFO!

Comment[When to play P15 and when to play Q14?  This is rather a difficult question.  Fan's later work showed that if B plays Q14 here, W will be able to get P9 point.  Probably for this reason, B \(Shi\) decided to play P15. \(Nowadays, however, P15 is seldom seen, for most modern playes don't like W to get in the corner with R17.\)]

;
White[sm]
Comment[W believes B would have to play T9 here.  After than, whenever B skips a move, W can kill B O6 group.  However B can in fact skip T9 since B has \(after W T8\) P10 and Q11 sente to live right group.  Fortunately for W, this miscalculation will not hurt him.]

Black[qq]

Comment[To here, B paid about 10 points \(losing Q5 and yielding T7 to W\) at the right to get a corner that is yet clean \(W still has S2\).  More importantly, B is still gote.  So the conclusion \(by Chen 9p\) is that B failed in this fight at lower right quadrant.

\(Editor: This fight from W #93 to B #150 is the most complex and most difficult fight in all Dang Hu Games.  When Chen 9p made the above conclusion, he was not very confident.  "Save for later people to study further," he also said.\)]

Hi everyone!

This is Game 9; one to go! :)

This game is dedicated to *dmitri*, who in real life is my roommate.  He was
probably the only unbeaten player in IGSWCT'92 (he won a game and dropped
off :-).  Well, he didn't drop off to keep this "unbeaten record"; rather,
he was very busy.  He has been working very hard on his violin.  He works
so hard on violin that I would be ashamed if I don't work hard on Go. :) Of
course, violin will be his profession, while Go will not be my profession.
:(

Go is my life.

Although W S11 would be a good move in this case, B R11 would force W to play S12 and B would become very thick.  But now with O10, when B R11, W could play R10 cut.]

Comment[
Hi, everyone!

Here we go -- the final game of the Dang Hu Games.  This game actually
appeared in this same newsgroup before, posted by jansteen.  On first look
they looked like two different games, but a closer look told me that they
were the same game shown from two different angles.

Thus an idea stroke me; I would like to take this opportunity to post the
following question: Assume a Go game is highly asymmetric (which is the
case in almost all played Go games), how many outlooks a single game can
have?  That is, you can turn the Go board 90 degrees or 270 degrees, for
example, but you know that is the same game you're looking at.

Of course, the board has to be always upright standing on the screen of
your terminal; you can not turn the board by, say, 1 degree or 2 -- that
will be very uninteresting.

Simple, isn't it?  Well, that's what I have in mind.  After playing so
many hard games, I would like everyone to do some simple exercises like
this.  But, please, answer it!

So I can laugh at you . :)))))

Okay so I hope everyone to have some fun, and I certainly have not
forgotten my promise to dedicate every game to a person who has helped me
to learn and play Go.  This game, Game 10 of Dang Hu Games, is dedicated to
*eightk*, who is not an 8 kyu. :)

He taught me Go.

Had W played C15 first \(without W F15 and B F14 yet\), when B B15 and W B16, B would have to play B14 instead of a possible D15.]

Comment[Only move.  If H16 first, B simply J16.  Then when W H18, B F17 is good.  Thus B would create a ko, and W wouldn't have any ko threats while B has at least one in J12.]

Comment[Good timing.  Normally, W will have to get B19 now to live, but in this shape, B would have G16.]

Comment[Mistake.  Should play G17.  Althought B can create a ko no matter W plays G17 or K18, but with W G17, it would be a more difficult ko for B to win \(or an easier ko for W to win\).  Now with K18, W gives the ko advantage to B.  W K18 is a casual move.]
White[jb]
;
Comment[B gets an advantageous ko in hand, so B is clearly successful here.  However, W corner is not completely dead yet, plus B's upper right corner is still thin.  Therefore, it's still too early to judege that B's situation is optimistic.]
Black[ga]
;
Comment[W could also consider R17.  But that way, after exchanges at the corner, W wouldn't be able to take the advantage of W's thickness at the left.  Now W P14, hoping to attack B R9 by threatening B's upper right corner.]
White[of]
;
Comment[B's corner was already thin before W P14, so B should strengthen his corner here, it seems.  B R12 is rather unexpected, showing a great deal of toughness -- also showing his confidence to live the corner.  Indeed, W's invasion into the corner right now wouldn't be effective.]

White[oq]

Black[np]

Comment[So W decides to give B R9 and R12 two stones some indirect pressure by strengthening his lower right.  If W can generate plenty of ko threats during the process, he can hope to gain by playing a ko with B at upper left.]

Comment[B H19 would be steady and solid. O15 is to use offense as a defense, quite severe.  However it's very risky since now W can make the upper left a tight ko at anytime, and if B is to lose this ko, eh's lose territory worth nearly 60 points.  Why so risky? Apparently B isn't optimistic about the situation.]

Comment[To here B lives at the right, and the fight here comes to a pause.  B captures upper left, thus leads in territory.  But W has also gained: 1. Lower right; 2. Weakened three B stones at the bottom; 3. Upper right B team is not completely alive; 4. Upper left W team is not completely dead, providing numerous ko threats.]

Comment[To here, although W manages to save a few stones, B's middle is considerably thickened, thus the lower left weak B team gets a big help.  Moreover, the upper left "store of ko threats" for W has lost its value \(later when B takes D16 stones, W will have to play L15 to make an eye\), and B has P7 to threaten a cut.  B has turned it around to take the lead.]

Comment[B wins by 2.5 zi \(5 points\).

Overview: In this game, the variations at upper left, upper right, and lower left three corners were interesting and spectacular.  A remarkable fact was that even W seemed to lose at the upper left, from a global point of view, W wasn't exactly lagging.  In other words, Fan and Shi had the ability to control the global situation over local details.  They once again lived up
with the title of "Great National Hands."]
