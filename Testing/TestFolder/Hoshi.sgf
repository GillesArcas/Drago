Choosing a joseki:
Since josekis work effectively in a certain direction, examine
positions at adjacent corners and sides before choosing a joseki.
The opposite corner matters only if a ladder is involved. Some
guidelines:
1. Have support for a fight - A high position provides support,
a low position does not.
2. Take the side with most value.
2a. A juncture point for both sides is of great value.
2b. A side where making territory is uncertain is of little value.
3. Consider strategic balance.
4. Get sente, if there are more big points on the board.
5. If there are two variations with similar outcome, but one
with a ladder and one without, avoid the ladder, because you
don't need to risk an opponent's ladder breaker.

How to learn joseki:
If you don't know joseki or a specific joseki, which you want
to learn, don't try to remember every single branching, you find
here. Look first for the main and correct variations, which are
marked out with a '*', and try to remember the most easy ones
of them. You don't need to know each branching you find here.
When you learn a joseki, look also for the follow-ups in the
middle- and end-game.
Use a new learned joseki in your real games, immediately after
you learned it, until you can vizualize it coming onto the board
in a rush, without trying to stress your memory in search of
each next joseki-move.
If something goes wrong or you want to know more, look up the
variations of deviations, special strategies, trick plays and
mistakes here. To understand, why there are only for special
situations or mistakes anytime, compare their results with the
results of good variations in nearby branchings instead of looking
at their results for themselves. Open this file twice to put
two results beside each other on your screen.

Hoshi = Hwajeom, Seongjeom = Xingwei` = Star Point
---------------------------------------------------------

The star or hoshi (4-4) point, emphasizing influence at the potential
expense of territory.

The first experiments with the star point were around 1840 in
Japan; its first appearances in pro games date to the early 1900's.
Its rise to preeminence came during the 'New Fuseki' movement
in Japan in the mid-1930's.

White approaches with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *' or 'd *'. White 'a'
is the standard approach move, the variations after it cover
the great majority of hoshi joseki.
Other approaches invite a local loss, but may make sense strategically.

'e' covers White playing elsewhere. These variations show White
approaches when there are multiple Black stones locally.

'f' shows the too early sansan invasion (which is not joseki).

'g *' shows a splitting move (esp. when Black has already played at
the top).

'h' is feasible if strategically sensible.

'i' is a move on the side preparing to approach from the other
side.

'j', 'k' and 'l' are covered in another branching.

(;W[qf]C[
Ikken Kakari = Hankan Keolch'im = Yi Gua`jiao~ = 1-Space Low Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------------

White 2 is the standard approach move to the 4-4.

Black joseki responses range from 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *', 'g *', 'h *', 'i *', 'm' or 'n'. 

The variations after 'a *' and 'b *' should be studied together
to understand similarities and differences.

'c *' leads to much more complications than the other answers,
but White can simplify.

'd' is called Tsuke-Nobi-Joseki. Its shape also occurs on the
side without corner. Kyu and low dan players should totally avoid
playing this variation, regard it as bad move and instead play an
extension (a - c) or a pincer.

Black needs the ladder for 'e *'. An additional stone on  n  is also very helpful.

'f' is not generally favorable for Black, nor joseki. 'f' is better than 'i', if there's a Black stone on the triangled point.

'j', 'k' and 'l' show special strategies based upon the fuseki.

'o' shows Black ignoring the approach move (White 2) and invasion into different extensions and moyos based on the Hoshi.

'p' shows the greedy play of using the star point immediately
for territory.

'q' is possible if White is not on the top side.

'r' is a trick play.

's' is covered in two other branches.

Ikken-Tobi (1-space jump)
----------------------------

White responses range from 'a' to 'f *' or 'l' or 'n'.

White may also play elsewhere ('g').

If White already has a stone on the triangled point, he may slide
to 'h *', 'i *' or 'j *'.

'k' and 'm' are invasions.

'n' can be more preferable than 'c' in six stone handicap games.

Black 3 is solid and defensive. White continues with 'a *', 'b
*', 'c *', 'd *', 'e' or 'h'.

'e' is almost joseki and an invention of Kobayashi Koiichi.

'f' is only good as ko threat or in handicap go.

'g' initiates a trick play, if there is an additional Black stone
on the triangled position like in handicap games.

White continues with 'a *', 'b *', 'c *', 'd *', 'e *' to 'g *' or 'j'. White 'd', the nose contact play, is a trick play.

Black 3 is the most complicated answer to the White approach.
To avoid all variations, players who don't know them treat the
position as if Black had played the keima instead and continue
on 'h'. This involves only a minor loss of territorial balance
for sake of simplicity.

'i' is a mistake.

Nikken Basami = Dukan Hyeopgong = E`r Jia = 2-Space Low Pincer
---------------------------------------------------------------

Black 3, the two-space low pincer, at best indicates a special
strategy. 

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space
pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most
often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the
same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is
less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer,
if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely
to later come under attack if White establishes a base for White
2.

White continues with 'a' to 'c'.

'd' continues on the right side against a Black komoku. In this branch is explained, when Black 3 is to be applied.

White 'e' and 'f' are not recommended.

White continues with 'A'. 

White 'B' gives life in a small space, with considerable black
thickness. 

White 'C' and 'D' are not recommended.

After White tenukis 'E', Black closes the corner.


If there is one more additional Black stone on or near the marked 
point, White must play differently. For this case, see the variation, 
where a Black stone on the 3-10-point of the top site is included 
first.
