White[dp]
Comment[(* This game was played in a hotel in Atami on February 20 and 21, 1957.  On this day, Sakata Eio 9-dan and Hashimoto Utaro 9-dan's game was also played here.  Kitani [Minoru\] 9-dan and Fujisawa [Hosai\] 9-dan also came to watch the games.   All six participants of the Strongest Deciding Matches gathered at the same place -- indeed a rare opportunity. *)]

Black[cd]
Comment[(* In this game, Go Seigen 9-dan defied the traditional way of playing the so-called "great avalanche" joseki, making a revolutionary new variation that shocked Japan's Go world. *)

(* Generally speaking, new variations in josekis are made due to the following two reasons:

(* First, based on the surrounding situation, any known joseki moves is not satisfactory.  Therefore, to fit the current situation, one decides to make a change, thus a new move.

(* Second, contrary to the above case, one has fully studied a new move 
already, and he attempts to apply it in practice on purpose; or, in a game under appropriate situation, he suddenly realizes it's time to make this new move.

(* In the first case, a new move is made by chance under a special situation, therefore its application is quite limited.

(* Only the new moves made in the second case are purely new moves. The new variation Go Seigen 9-dan made has a fundamentally difference in the order of moves with the way everyone had been playing in the most popular "great avalanche" joseki.  Strictly speaking, it's a "revolutionary 
joseki." This joseki is extremely valuable for study, and it will be widely used hereafter. *)]

Comment[Playing at hoshi points [stars\] is what Mr. Takagawa likes. In the creation of New Fuseki Era, Mr. Kitani and I had studied san-ren-sei fuseki, and we often played at hoshi points.  Recently Mr. Takagawa often chooses these openings.]
;
Black[oc]
Comment[B #5 to enclose at [a\] is also a beautiful move.]
;
White[ed]
Comment[W #6 also can approach from a lower position, point [a\].

W played hoshi points at the two corners at the lower side, so he tries to get a high position at the top side as well.  To here, it's an opening also commonly seen if the colors are reversed -- That is, if B gets two hoshi points at the lower side, and W plays two komoku [3-4 points\] at the upper side, B would then play [E16\].]

Comment[W #12 is the biggest point on the board.

This move to play [a\] at the lower side to form san-ren-sei is also a pretty strong formation, but W #12 also prevents B from extending from the komoku shimari [corner enclosure\] at the upper right.  Therefore, #12 is the biggest point.]

Black[nq]

Comment[In the past, B #13 had been normally played at [a\] to split the side, but nowadays it's more often played as shown to approach the corner.

B[a\] to split the corner shows an unhurried manner, while B #13 kakari tends to settle a local shape quickly.  This [B #13\] implies the severity of modern fuseki.

Comment[When there are the two marked B stones, this White move is normally considered too strong.  The reason W plays so is because he has spent two moves to capture [N4\] stone, so W is now trying to utilize this thickness.

Since W has invested for thickness, he now will have to make most out of this investment so that he will have the advantage in future battles.  This is certainly expected.]

Comment[(* #37 this new move shocked the Go world.

Wu Qing Yuan:

"Since the normal [traditional\] way doesn't seem ideal, I thought of #37 to bend inward.  This was a move that I had studied before.  Even without [D10\] stone [marked\], this [#37\] would be a powerful move.

"'Great avalanche' joseki had been used since 20 years ago [20 years before 1957\].  Why had professional players never found this move [#37 bending inward\]?  I think the reason was that the shape of this move didn't look good, thus it was overlooked, becoming a blind spot."

Comment[B #45 blocks, and the three W stones at the corner are captured.

Next, even if W[a\], B[b\] and B wins the semeai by one liberty.

(* Two days after Go Seigen 9-dan played this new variation, Sakata Eio 9-dan immediately applied this move (B17) in NHK sponsored lightning games, even astonishing his opponent Shimamura 8-dan.

(* Hasegawa 8-dan published an article, "My Study Notes", on "Igo" magazine (1957.5).  In the article, he studied the new move.

(* Maeda Nobuaki 9-dan carefully explained the development of "great avalanche" joseki in an article "The Changes in a Joseki." In the article, he especially mentioned the new move by Go Seigen. *)

(* Would this joseki [after the change\] be widely used afterwards?  If "great avalanche" joseki thereafter disappeared in the games, then it would mean that people had the conclusion: #37 was indeed a great move [for B\], and it led good results for B. If a variation is only favorable to one side, then it cannot be joseki, and it would certainly disappear in the games. *)]

Comment[W cannot extend to [a\] ([M17\]).  If W[a\], B[b\] and W would be in trouble.  So W certainly would play [F12\] or [b\] to escape.]

Comment[The formation to here is expected.  Since W already has a stone on the right side [Q10\] [marked\], so even if B [J15\]-[L16\] two moves form some moyo, it wouldn't have much effect.  This way, B cannot be satisfied.

Comment[The end of the traditional joseki. But in this situation, the marked stone at D19 is now inefficient, being too close to the Black wall. Here, it would be better to have the D10 stone at 'a' (R12), for example.]

Wu Qing Yuan:

"When I once played with Mr. Kitani, I chose this variation.  If W [Q10\] [marked\] was at [a\] ([R10\]), a lower position, this ogeima variation could certainly be considered. But in this game, [Q10\] is high, and I didn't want to choose this variation."
