<h2>Drago translation</h2>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<h3>Current status</h3>

<p>Drago is currently translated into 13 languages: Chinese
(simplified, traditional and Martian), Czech, English, French, German,
Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish and
Vietnamese.
The available translation
files may be found in the install directory.</p>

<p>This page will give you some information if you want to add
your own translation.</p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Translation files</h3>

<p>The translation files are text files with ini-like format:</p>

<p><code>... <br>
File=Fichier <br>
Navigation=Navigation <br>
... </code></p>

<p>The left side is in English, the right side is the
translation. The file is organized by windows, dialog boxes,
messages, etc. To start a translation, choose the available
language closest to your own language or use the English
translation file.</p>

<p>As Drago is Unicode enable, the translation files are encoded
using UTF-8 format which enables to store any character from any
language. As long as you correctly see the translation in your
editor and in Drago, you should not worry about encoding. </p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>To translate</h3>

<p>Two solutions: </p>

<p>1/ Use NotePad, or any text editor UTF-8 enable. </p>

<p>2/ Use <a href="LangPad.zip">LangPad</a>. I have written this
tool to help translators of Drago. It handles directly UTF-8 and
has some features which I hope may be useful. </p>

<hr size="1" color="#C0C0C0">

<h3>Translating with LangPad</h3>

<p>LangPad is very simple and very close to NotePad in what
concerns standard editing. The only things worthy to mention are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>it opens and saves files directly in UTF-8.</li>
    <li>You can display only the lines to be completed by
        selecting the Filter&gt;To be completed menu. When
        pushing again the Filter button, the file is shown
        without filtering, the cursor being on the current line
        when leaving the filter mode.</li>
    <li>You can display only the lines containing a given string
        by selecting the Filter&gt;Filter on search menu. The
        same applies when pressing again the Filter button. Note
        that the search is case sensitive and applies to the
        whole line.</li>
    <li>It will not be able to save additional strings (if ever
        you had to add your own comments for instance).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this help!</p>

<h3>Some notes about the translation files</h3>

<h4>&quot;BOM&quot; (Byte Order Mark)</h4>

<p>You may see three weird characters at the start of the
translation files. These characters have a special meaning.
They tag the files as being UTF-8 and
enable for instance NotePad to open these files directly as UTF-8
without specifying it. Depending on the editor you use, they may
appear or disappear. As long as you see your translation
correctly in Drago, all is ok.</p>

<h4>Comments / Titles</h4>

<p>Strings starting with a semicolon &quot;;&quot; are comments,
giving some explanations or the name of the dialog where come
from the strings to translate. These comments do not appear in
Drago and can be ignored when translating. </p>

<h4>Language</h4>

<p>The string $Language stores the name of your language as it
will appear in the option dialog. There are 2 possibilities: put
it in English (anybody can understand it) or put it your language
(only the ones who are interested in can understand it). For
instance: 'French' versus 'Français'. </p>

<h4>HelpFile</h4>

<p>The string $HelpFile is initialized with the name of the
English help file. Another choice is the French help file. </p>

<h4>Translation credit</h4>

<p>The string $TranslationCredit stores a message appearing in
the About dialog box with url and mail address active links. It
can be initialized with some message, your name, mail or website
(at most 3 lines separated by \n). Take a look at the current
translations to get the idea. </p>

<h4>Translations dependant on context</h4>

<p>Some few strings in English must be translated in other
languages with different words. For instance, &quot;game&quot; is
translated into French with &quot;partie&quot; or &quot;jeu&quot;
depending on the context. The different meanings are named by the
English string followed by a number in the lng file, for instance
Game and Game2. </p>

<p>If you must disambiguate some string, please tell me. I will
update the program to take this into account. </p>

<p>The same remarks applies for character case. The functions
accessing to the language files are not case sensitive. So, some
strings have different keys to cope with different cases. Refer
to context or another translation file.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Format specification</p>

<p>Some strings include the character % followed by a letter (%s, %d, %f) possibly
with some value between % and the letter (%2.2f). This is a notation used in
a lot of programming languages and is replaced at run time by a string or a numerical
value.</p>
<p>
<p>It is important to keep unchanged this notation.</p>
<p>
<p>Some strings may include several % and if ever your translation needs to reverse
the order of the values, you can used the notation used in this example from Turkish:</p>
<p>
<p>
<code>   Page %d of %d=%1:d sayfanın %0:d.si</code>
<p>
<p>As usual, in case of any doubt, please contact me.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Printing
formats</p>

<p>Some strings appear in the print section and are related to
the formats of headers, footers and titles. Some keywords,
starting with a slash character (e.g. \game or \left), enable to
specify the format and are not to be translated.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Shortened
strings</p>

<p>Some strings to be translated are shortened (two currently).
They are related to the longuest messages and end with
&quot;etc.&quot;. Please refer to the English translation file to
get the complete message. </p>

<h3>To conclude</h3>

<p>Remember that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>You can see your translation at work without quitting and
        starting again Drago. Just open the option dialog and
        press Ok. This will update the translation.</li>
    <li>New versions add some strings to translate, usually very
        few compared to the current file.</li>
    <li>I will be always very glad to help you if you have any
        question or problem.</li>
